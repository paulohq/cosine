Anarchism Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as self governed voluntary institutions but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non hierarchical free associations Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary or harmful While anti statism is central some argue that anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations including but not limited to the state system As a subtle and anti dogmatic philosophy anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy There are many types and traditions of anarchism not all of which are mutually exclusive Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications Anarchism is usually considered a radical left wing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarcho communism and anarcho syndicalism with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organisations Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression supporting self defense or non violence anarcho pacifism while others have supported the use of some coercive measures including violent revolution and propaganda of the deed on the path to an anarchist society The term anarchism is a compound word composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the Greek i e anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix an i e without and archos i e leader ruler cf archon or arkhe i e authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix izein The first known use of this word was in Anarchist was the term adopted by Maximilien de Robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of though among these anarchists there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs Pierre Joseph Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century Since the s from France the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the s in the United States its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States On the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th century BC among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan Zhuangzi s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist Zhuangzi wrote A petty thief is put in jail A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics their contemporary Zeno of Citium the founder of Stoicism also introduced similar topics Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition Georges Lechartier wrote that The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles In early Islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society Later some Muslim scholars such as Amer al Basri and Abu Hanifa led movements of boycotting the rulers paving the way to the awqaf endowments tradition which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry The French renaissance political philosopher Etienne de La Boetie wrote in his most famous work the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th century in England The term anarchist first entered the English language in during the English Civil War as a term of abuse used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents By the time of the French Revolution some such as the Enrages began to use the term positively in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic By the turn of the th century the English word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment particularly Jean Jacques Rousseau s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom As part of the political turmoil of the s in the wake of the French Revolution William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought Godwin was according to Peter Kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism He argued in Political Justice that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power Rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution His aversion to the imposition of a rules based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people s mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation In each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment The French Pierre Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work What is Property published in It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is Liberty is the mother not the daughter of order In What is Property Proudhon answers with the famous accusation Property is theft In this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriete where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish He contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use Later however Proudhon added that Property is Liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power His opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time The anarcho communist Joseph Dejacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian Unlike Pierre Joseph Proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature In in Germany the post hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book The Ego and Its Own which will later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism Anarchists active in the Revolution in France included Anselme Bellegarrigue Ernest Coeurderoy Joseph Dejacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon In Europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt In Spain Ramon de la Sagra established the anarchist journal El Porvenir in La Coruna in which was inspired by Proudhon s ideas The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon s works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party According to George Woodcock These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after but before that time Proudhonian ideas as interpreted by Pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early s According to the Encyclopedia Britannica During the Spanish revolution of Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized or cantonalist political system on Proudhonian lines In the International Workingmen s Association sometimes called the First International united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon Blanquists Philadelphes English trade unionists socialists and social democrats Due to its links to active workers movements the International became a significant organisation Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council Proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed Marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings In following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom LPF Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International which had decided not to get involved with the LPF They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property At first the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction Subsequently the International became polarised into two camps with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads Bakunin characterised Marx s ideas as centralist and predicted that if a Marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune and in the General Council called only a special conference in London One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy while a technical excuse that they had split away from the Federation Romande was used to avoid inviting Bakunin s Swiss supporters Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the General Council s resolutions passed almost unanimously Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers In the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York In response the federalist sections formed their own International at the St Imier Congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist program The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from March more formally from March to May The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco Prussian War Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune They included George Woodcock states The anti authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the State with the free and spontaneous organisation of labour In the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions FOTLU of the United States and Canada unanimously set May as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard In response unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event On May in Chicago a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd The next day May anarchists staged a rally at Chicago s Haymarket Square A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer In the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution The incident became known as the Haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day In a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair Although it had initially been conceived as a once off event by the following year the celebration of International Workers Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker s holiday In the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including Errico Malatesta Pierre Monatte Luigi Fabbri Benoit Broutchoux Emma Goldman Rudolf Rocker and Christiaan Cornelissen Various themes were treated during the Congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient He thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it The Spanish Workers Federation in was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain The most successful was the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo National Confederation of Labour CNT founded in Before the s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics attracting million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association a federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in with delegates representing two million workers from countries in Europe and Latin America In Latin America in particular The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America and until the early s most of the trade unions in Mexico Brazil Peru Chile and Argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the Spanish C N T as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions Some anarchists such as Johann Most advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda By the s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides From onwards the Russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society Moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt France s Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism However as soon as important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le Revolte that a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement The anarcho syndicalist Fernand Pelloutier argued in for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter State repression including the infamous French lois scelerates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the Paris Commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts Numerous heads of state were assassinated between and by members of the anarchist movement For example U S President McKinley s assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because international terrorism arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite This image remains to this day Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I and the October Revolution Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution However following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the Kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine There in the Free Territory they fought in the civil war against the Whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising before they left Russia Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised For them Bakunin s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements In France and the United States for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International The revolutionary wave of saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists Gustav Landauer Silvio Gesell and Erich Muhsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures In the Italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana grew to members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union members plus Umanita Nova its daily paper grew accordingly Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early s it lead a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho communist Ricardo Flores Magon In Paris the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles which included Nestor Makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism Their manifesto called the Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft was supported Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives In the s this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations In the s and s the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism s conflict with the state Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution In France where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February riots anarchists divided over a united front policy Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II In Germany the anarchist Erich Muhsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of February within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin Joseph Goebbels the Nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those Jewish subversives Over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg Brandenburg and finally Oranienburg On February Muhsam was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of July Muhsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning In Spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory But in the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power Months later the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War In response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land But even before the fascist victory in the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily Catalonia Aragon Andalusia and parts of the Levante Much of Spain s economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence as the Soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment Factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution which he claimed came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history Stalinist led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District In the early s the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociacion Libertaria de Cuba Cuban Libertarian Association From to the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new Communist regime In in France the Federation Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confederation nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist Federazione Anarchica Italiana was founded in Italy Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September and in the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May After World War II an appeal in the Fraye Arbeter Shtime detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them By February the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large scale operation The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ Die Freie Gesellschaft which survived until In the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded In the Anarcho Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation The Syndicalist Workers Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post war Britain and one of Solidarity Federation s earliest predecessors It was formed in by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain Unlike the AFB which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as Albert Camus Herbert Read Paul Goodman Dwight Macdonald Allen Ginsberg George Woodcock Leopold Kohr Julian Beck John Cage and the French Surrealist group led by Andre Breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Federation Anarchiste Anarcho pacifism became influential in the Anti nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho pacifists Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day Anarcho pacifism became a basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham s Volume Two The Emergence of the New Anarchism A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the s and s Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts In in Carrara Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in by the three existing European federations of France the Federation Anarchiste the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile In the United Kingdom in the s this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona Spain In Denmark squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen Since the revival of anarchism in the mid th century a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the s Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the st century formed by far the majority of anarchists Around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization WTO Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police These actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations the International Workers Association and International Libertarian Solidarity The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the Confederacion General del Trabajo CGT and the CNT CGT membership was estimated at around for Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho syndicalist Youth Federation the CNT AIT in France the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation and Anarchist Federation The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World claiming paying members and the International Workers Association an anarcho syndicalist successor to the First International also remain active Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty i e opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill recognizing equality of entitlement In a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid th century and after Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Marmol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms i e collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought Mutualism began in th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States Proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance For this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism Proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict In William Godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote Political Justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism Godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge Godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good An influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the German Max Stirner Stirner s The Ego and Its Own published in is a founding text of the philosophy According to Stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for God state or morality To Stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality Stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals Egoism has inspired many interpretations of Stirner s philosophy It was re discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist John Henry Mackay Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during The Peaceful Revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster It is apparent that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews William B Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form Henry David Thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe Thoreau was an American author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading transcendentalist He is best known for his books Walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay Civil Disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner s egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France These authors and activists included Oscar Wilde Emile Armand Han Ryner Henri Zisly Renzo Novatore Miguel Gimenez Igualada Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi among others Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion It is the largest school of thought in anarchism Social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid Collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised This was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production However collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society Anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a post revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need Anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom Most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society Anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro organisationalist and insurrectionary anti organisationalist sections To date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society i e established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution Russian Revolution Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War starting in anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of Francoismthe regime that won the war Adolf HitlerHitler Mussolini Spanish Communist Party repression backed by the USSR as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself During the Russian Revolution anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army

argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead Criticisms of anarchism include moralitymoral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics European history professor Carl Landauer in his book European Socialism argued that social anarchism is
