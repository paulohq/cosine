Anarchism Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as self governed voluntary institutions but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non hierarchical free associations Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary or harmful While anti statism is central some argue that anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations including but not limited to the state system As a subtle and anti dogmatic philosophy anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy There are many types and traditions of anarchism not all of which are mutually exclusive Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications Anarchism is usually considered a radical left wing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarcho communism and anarcho syndicalism with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organisations Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression supporting self defense or non violence anarcho pacifism while others have supported the use of some coercive measures including violent revolution and propaganda of the deed on the path to an anarchist society The term anarchism is a compound word composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the Greek i e anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix an i e without and archos i e leader ruler cf archon or arkhe i e authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix izein The first known use of this word was in Anarchist was the term adopted by Maximilien de Robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of though among these anarchists there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs Pierre Joseph Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century Since the s from France the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the s in the United States its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States On the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th century BC among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan Zhuangzi s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist Zhuangzi wrote A petty thief is put in jail A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics their contemporary Zeno of Citium the founder of Stoicism also introduced similar topics Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition Georges Lechartier wrote that The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles In early Islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society Later some Muslim scholars such as Amer al Basri and Abu Hanifa led movements of boycotting the rulers paving the way to the awqaf endowments tradition which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry The French renaissance political philosopher Etienne de La Boetie wrote in his most famous work the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th century in England The term anarchist first entered the English language in during the English Civil War as a term of abuse used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents By the time of the French Revolution some such as the Enrages began to use the term positively in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic By the turn of the th century the English word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment particularly Jean Jacques Rousseau s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom As part of the political turmoil of the s in the wake of the French Revolution William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought Godwin was according to Peter Kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism He argued in Political Justice that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power Rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution His aversion to the imposition of a rules based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people s mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation In each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment The French Pierre Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work What is Property published in It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is Liberty is the mother not the daughter of order In What is Property Proudhon answers with the famous accusation Property is theft In this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriete where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish He contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use Later however Proudhon added that Property is Liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power His opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time The anarcho communist Joseph Dejacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian Unlike Pierre Joseph Proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature In in Germany the post hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book The Ego and Its Own which will later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism Anarchists active in the Revolution in France included Anselme Bellegarrigue Ernest Coeurderoy Joseph Dejacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon In Europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt In Spain Ramon de la Sagra established the anarchist journal El Porvenir in La Coruna in which was inspired by Proudhon s ideas The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon s works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party According to George Woodcock These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after but before that time Proudhonian ideas as interpreted by Pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early s According to the Encyclopedia Britannica During the Spanish revolution of Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized or cantonalist political system on Proudhonian lines In the International Workingmen s Association sometimes called the First International united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon Blanquists Philadelphes English trade unionists socialists and social democrats Due to its links to active workers movements the International became a significant organisation Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council Proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed Marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings In following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom LPF Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International which had decided not to get involved with the LPF They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property At first the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction Subsequently the International became polarised into two camps with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads Bakunin characterised Marx s ideas as centralist and predicted that if a Marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune and in the General Council called only a special conference in London One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy while a technical excuse that they had split away from the Federation Romande was used to avoid inviting Bakunin s Swiss supporters Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the General Council s resolutions passed almost unanimously Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers In the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York In response the federalist sections formed their own International at the St Imier Congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist program The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from March more formally from March to May The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco Prussian War Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune They included George Woodcock states The anti authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the State with the free and spontaneous organisation of labour In the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions FOTLU of the United States and Canada unanimously set May as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard In response unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event On May in Chicago a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd The next day May anarchists staged a rally at Chicago s Haymarket Square A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer In the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution The incident became known as the Haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day In a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair Although it had initially been conceived as a once off event by the following year the celebration of International Workers Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker s holiday In the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including Errico Malatesta Pierre Monatte Luigi Fabbri Benoit Broutchoux Emma Goldman Rudolf Rocker and Christiaan Cornelissen Various themes were treated during the Congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient He thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it The Spanish Workers Federation in was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain The most successful was the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo National Confederation of Labour CNT founded in Before the s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics attracting million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association a federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in with delegates representing two million workers from countries in Europe and Latin America In Latin America in particular The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America and until the early s most of the trade unions in Mexico Brazil Peru Chile and Argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the Spanish C N T as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions Some anarchists such as Johann Most advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda By the s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides From onwards the Russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society Moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt France s Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism However as soon as important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le Revolte that a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement The anarcho syndicalist Fernand Pelloutier argued in for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter State repression including the infamous French lois scelerates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the Paris Commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts Numerous heads of state were assassinated between and by members of the anarchist movement For example U S President McKinley s assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because international terrorism arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite This image remains to this day Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I and the October Revolution Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution However following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the Kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine There in the Free Territory they fought in the civil war against the Whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising before they left Russia Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised For them Bakunin s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements In France and the United States for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International The revolutionary wave of saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists Gustav Landauer Silvio Gesell and Erich Muhsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures In the Italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana grew to members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union members plus Umanita Nova its daily paper grew accordingly Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early s it lead a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho communist Ricardo Flores Magon In Paris the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles which included Nestor Makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism Their manifesto called the Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft was supported Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives In the s this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations In the s and s the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism s conflict with the state Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution In France where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February riots anarchists divided over a united front policy Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II In Germany the anarchist Erich Muhsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of February within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin Joseph Goebbels the Nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those Jewish subversives Over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg Brandenburg and finally Oranienburg On February Muhsam was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of July Muhsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning In Spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory But in the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power Months later the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War In response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land But even before the fascist victory in the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily Catalonia Aragon Andalusia and parts of the Levante Much of Spain s economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence as the Soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment Factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution which he claimed came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history Stalinist led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District In the early s the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociacion Libertaria de Cuba Cuban Libertarian Association From to the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new Communist regime In in France the Federation Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confederation nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist Federazione Anarchica Italiana was founded in Italy Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September and in the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May After World War II an appeal in the Fraye Arbeter Shtime detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them By February the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large scale operation The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ Die Freie Gesellschaft which survived until In the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded In the Anarcho Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation The Syndicalist Workers Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post war Britain and one of Solidarity Federation s earliest predecessors It was formed in by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain Unlike the AFB which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as Albert Camus Herbert Read Paul Goodman Dwight Macdonald Allen Ginsberg George Woodcock Leopold Kohr Julian Beck John Cage and the French Surrealist group led by Andre Breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Federation Anarchiste Anarcho pacifism became influential in the Anti nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho pacifists Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day Anarcho pacifism became a basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham s Volume Two The Emergence of the New Anarchism A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the s and s Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts In in Carrara Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in by the three existing European federations of France the Federation Anarchiste the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile In the United Kingdom in the s this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona Spain In Denmark squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen Since the revival of anarchism in the mid th century a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the s Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the st century formed by far the majority of anarchists Around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization WTO Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police These actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations the International Workers Association and International Libertarian Solidarity The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the Confederacion General del Trabajo CGT and the CNT CGT membership was estimated at around for Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho syndicalist Youth Federation the CNT AIT in France the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation and Anarchist Federation The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World claiming paying members and the International Workers Association an anarcho syndicalist successor to the First International also remain active Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty i e opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill recognizing equality of entitlement In a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid th century and after Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Marmol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms i e collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought Mutualism began in th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States Proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance For this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism Proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict In William Godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote Political Justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism Godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge Godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good An influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the German Max Stirner Stirner s The Ego and Its Own published in is a founding text of the philosophy According to Stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for God state or morality To Stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality Stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals Egoism has inspired many interpretations of Stirner s philosophy It was re discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist John Henry Mackay Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during The Peaceful Revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster It is apparent that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews William B Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form Henry David Thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe Thoreau was an American author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading transcendentalist He is best known for his books Walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay Civil Disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner s egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France These authors and activists included Oscar Wilde Emile Armand Han Ryner Henri Zisly Renzo Novatore Miguel Gimenez Igualada Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi among others Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion It is the largest school of thought in anarchism Social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid Collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised This was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production However collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society Anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a post revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need Anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom Most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society Anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro organisationalist and insurrectionary anti organisationalist sections To date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society i e established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution Russian Revolution Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War starting in anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of Francoismthe regime that won the war Adolf HitlerHitler Mussolini Spanish Communist Party repression backed by the USSR as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself During the Russian Revolution anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army

syndicalists view trade unionlabour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the State politystate with a new society democratically self managed by workers The basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are Workers wikt Solidaritysolidarity Direct action and Workers self management Anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position will allow workers to liberate themselves Moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society should be self managing They should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement He outlined a view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his pamphlet Anarcho Syndicalism The International

within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology Anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary Coercioncoercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised Free association communism and anarchismfree association Anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the State politystate In essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa L Susan Brown claims that as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist Anarcha feminism began with the late th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre Anarcho pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence It developed mostly in the Netherlands Britain and the United States before and during the Second World War Christian anarchism is a Christian movementmovement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity Its main proponents included Leo Tolstoy Dorothy Day Ammon Hennacy and Jacques Ellul Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda s Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft The document was based on the experiences of Anarchism in RussiaRussian anarchists in the October Revolution which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups The Platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement s failures during the Russian Revolution Russian Revolution Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives In the s this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists Voline and Sebastien Faure It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations Post left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism s relationship to traditional Left wing politics Some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist Situationist International post left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrectionary anarchisminsurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses Instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies Post anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought drawing from diverse ideas including post modernism autonomist marxism post left anarchy Situationist International and postcolonialism Left wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti corporatist anti hierarchical pro labor positions and anti capitalism in economics and anti imperialism in foreign policy Anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state politystate in favour of sovereign individualindividual sovereignty in a free market Anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from Austrian School economics study of law and economics and public choice theory There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons

anarchist theory Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory File Emilearmand jpgthumb pxFrench individualist anarchist Emile Armand who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century An important current within anarchism is free love Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as a clear direct expression of an individual s self ownership Free love particularly stressed women s rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood s The Word free loveThe Word Free Society as The Firebrand as Free Society was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries The publication advocated free love and women s rights and critiqued Comstockery censorship of sexual information Also M E Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love In New York City s Greenwich Village Bohemianismbohemian feminists and socialists advocated self realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical Edna St Vincent Millay and the lesbian anarchist Margaret Anderson were prominent among them Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman among others Magnus Hirschfeld noted in that Goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only American to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public In fact before Goldman heterosexual anarchist Robert Reitzel spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the s in his Detroit based German language journal Der arme Teufel In Argentina anarcha feminist Virginia Bolten published the newspaper called which was published nine times in Rosario between January and January and was revived briefly in In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality Mujeres Libres was an anarchist women s organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women It was founded in by Lucia Sanchez Saornil Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gascon and had approximately members The organisation was based on the idea of a double struggle for Feminist movementwomen s liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel In order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists Lucia Sanchez Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha feminist federation Mujeres Libres who was open about her lesbianism She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment More recently the British anarcho pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual The Joy of Sex The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray in such works as Theorie du corps amoureux pour une erotique solaire and L invention du plaisir fragments cyreaniques File Fransisco Ferrer Guardia jpgleftthumbFrancesc Ferrer i Guardia Catalan peopleCatalan anarchist pedagogue and Freethoughtfree thinker For English anarchist William Godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness For Godwin education had to have A respect for the child s autonomy which precluded any form of coercion A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child s own motivation and initiatives and A concern about the child s capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school In his Political Justice he criticises state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government Early American anarchist Josiah Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established Max Stirner wrote in a long essay on education called The False Principle of our Education In it Stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that self understanding consists in hourly self creation Education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment In the United States freethought was a basically Anti Christianityanti christian anti clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters A number of contributors to Liberty Liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co editor of Freethought and for a time The Truth Seeker E C Walker was co editor of the excellent free thought free love journal Lucifer the Light Bearer Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer the Light Bearer Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty Liberty The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself In Catalan anarchist and Freethoughtfree thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guardia established modern or Progressive educationprogressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church The schools stated goal was to Popular educationeducate the working class in a rational secular and non coercive setting Fiercely anti clerical Ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state Murray Bookchin wrote This period s was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence Perhaps the best known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer s Modern School Escuela Moderna a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally La Escuela Moderna and Ferrer s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of Modern School United StatesModern Schools in the United States Cuba South America and London The first of these was started in New York City in It also inspired the Italian newspaper Universita popolare Italian newspaperUniversita popolare founded in Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate Tolstoy s educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture He thought that Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself Education is culture under restraint culture is free Education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary For him without compulsion education was transformed into culture A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the anarchist free schoolfree school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches Experiments in Germany led to A S Neill founding what became Summerhill School in Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice However although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se The term deschooling was popularised by Ivan Illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead Criticisms of anarchism include moralitymoral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics European history professor Carl Landauer in his book European Socialism argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force He also argued that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity Category Anarchism

Autism Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction verbal and non verbal communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum ASDs the other two being Asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as PDD NOS which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations or by rare combinations of common genetic variants In rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes such as heavy metals pesticides or childhood vaccines the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence The prevalence of autism is about per people worldwide and it occurs about four times more often in boys than girls The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC report of children in the United States one in are diagnosed with ASD a increase from one in in The number of people diagnosed as autistic has been increasing dramatically since the s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life The signs usually develop gradually but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress Early behavioral cognitive or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self care social and communication skills Although there is no known cure there have been reported cases of children who recovered Not many autistic children live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful An autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior Other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis Autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ASD see Classification from other developmental disorders Autistic people have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on Mars Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as the deficiency to point at things Three to five year old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others However they do form attachments to their primary caregivers Most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than non autistic children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD Older autistic children and adults perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition Autistic children suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for autistic individuals For them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel Functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply There are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in autistic individuals The limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums A study interviewed parents of autistic children and reported that about two thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one third had a history of aggression with tantrums significantly more common than in non autistic children with language impairments A Swedish study found that of individuals aged or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis About a third to a half of autistic individuals do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver In the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations than other children their gestures are less often integrated with words Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish autistic infants for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language In a pair of studies autistic children aged performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference As people are often sized up initially according to their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals may be likely to overestimate their audience s level of comprehension Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised RBS R categorizes as follows No single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family An estimated to of autistic individuals show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants Many autistic individuals show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population Sensory abnormalities are found in over of autistic individuals and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders Differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements An estimated of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of autistic children to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator Selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition Although some autistic children also have gastrointestinal GI symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear Parents of autistic children have higher levels of stress Siblings of autistic children report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship However they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome siblings of autistic individuals have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms However there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA but are heritable and influence gene expression Studies of twins suggest that heritability is for autism and as high as for ASD and siblings of those with autism are about times more likely to be autistic than the general population However most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified Typically autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD Numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis Hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes All known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies extensive searches are underway Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease heavy metals solvents diesel exhaust PCBs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress although no links have been found and some have been completely disproven Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the MMR vaccine for causing autism The latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children Autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain How autism occurs is not well understood Its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies Unlike many other brain disorders such as Parkinson s autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors Just after birth the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response Aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is possibly part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD Although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autism s processes As autoantibodies are found in conditions other than ASD and are not always present in ASD the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors Also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than of cases The mirror neuron system MNS theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action The MNS may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of autistic individuals delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in autistic children However autistic individuals also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object ASD related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a large scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the task positive network used in sustained attention and goal directed thinking In autistic people the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of self referential thought A brain imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in autistic individuals The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that autistic adults have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex From studies based on event related potentials transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli For example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals In the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with q deletion syndrome Research on autism schizophrenia relations for chromosome q chromosome p and chromosome p are inconclusive Two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition Simon Baron Cohen s empathizing systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents An extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing These theories are somewhat related to Baron Cohen s earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children s atypical responses to the Sally Anne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis However most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition In his review Kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people A related theory enhanced perceptual functioning focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism Neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful Diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism Autism is defined in the DSM IV TR as exhibiting at least six symptoms total including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects Onset must be prior to age three years with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder ICD uses essentially the same definition Several diagnostic instruments are available Two are commonly used in autism research the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised ADI R is a semistructured parent interview and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS uses observation and interaction with the child The Childhood Autism Rating Scale CARS is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child If warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as Landau Kleffner syndrome The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile X testing A genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations As new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice A US study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was years far above recommendations and that of children remained undiagnosed at age years Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms Conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders PDD which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior These symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance Of the five PDD forms Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes PDD not otherwise specified PDD NOS also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder Unlike with autism people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development The terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism Asperger syndrome and PDD NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders ASD or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism In this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism ASD and PDD are often used interchangeably ASD in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication Because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism LFA MFA and HFA based on IQ thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial Autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than autistic individuals the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome HFA and non syndromal autism is unclear Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from to months of age The validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior About half of parents of autistic children notice their child s unusual behaviors by age months and about four fifths notice by age months According to an article in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome US and Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at and months using autism specific formal screening tests In contrast in the UK children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened It is not known which approach is more effective Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers M CHAT the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire and the First Year Inventory initial data on M CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders Screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features The main goals when treating autistic children are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options Intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated Available approaches include applied behavior analysis ABA developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention an early intervention model for to hours a week for multiple years is an effective behavioral treatment for some autistic children Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails More than half of US children diagnosed as autistic are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics Aside from antipsychotics Both aripiprazole and risperidone are effective for treating irritability in children with autistic disorders there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for autistic adolescents and adults An autistic person may respond atypically to medications the medications can have adverse effects and no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism Although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk A study found that compared to their peers autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein free diets in botched chelation therapy killed a five year old autistic child Treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so For someone born in a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of net present value in dollars inflation adjusted from estimate with about medical care extra education and other care and lost economic productivity Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child and unreimbursed out of pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems one US study found a average loss of annual income in families of autistic children and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance After childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning There is no known cure Children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not It is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples of autistic children have ranged from to Most autistic children can acquire language by age or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years Most autistic children lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination Although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age Few high quality studies address long term prognosis Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife Acquiring language before age six having an IQ above and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism A British study of adults who were diagnosed before as autistic children with IQ above found that achieved a high level of independence as adults had some friends and were generally in work but required some support had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in ASD with a high level of support and very limited autonomy and needed high level hospital care A Swedish study of adults that did not exclude low IQ found worse prognosis for example only achieved independence A Canadian study of young adults diagnosed as autistic as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor fair good and very good of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives mostly in volunteer sheltered or part time work Changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children Most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of per for autism and close to per for ASD and per children in the United States for ASD as of because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate ASD s true prevalence PDD NOS s prevalence has been estimated at per Asperger syndrome at roughly per and childhood disintegrative disorder at per The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the s and early s This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls The sex ratio averages and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to with intellectual disability and more than without Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism Most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism Several other conditions are common in autistic children They include A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named The Table Talk of Martin Luther compiled by his notetaker Mathesius contains the story of a year old boy who may have been severely autistic Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report The earliest well documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue as detailed in a court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair s marriage to gain Blair s inheritance The Wild Boy of Aveyron a feral child caught in showed several signs of autism the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation The New Latin word autismus English translation autism was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia He derived it from the Greek word autos meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance The word autism first took its modern sense in when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a report of children with striking behavioral similarities Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger Kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mothers Starting in the late s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy As late as the mid s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children s behaviors are perceived negatively by others and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being 
Albedo Albedo or reflection coefficient derived from Latin albedo whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface It is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it Its dimensionless nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to for perfect reflection of a white surface Albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation When quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light In general the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation except for Lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution In practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function BRDF may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface but albedo is very useful as a first approximation The albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and calculating reflectivity of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings The average overall albedo of Earth its planetary albedo is to because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features The term was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his work Photometria Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body When seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms Most land areas are in an albedo range of to The average albedo of the Earth is about This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds Earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA s MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g Earth s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about C If Earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below C If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about C In contrast if the entire Earth is covered by water a so called aquaplanet the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under C It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle formula and the bi hemispherical reflectance formula the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination formula Albedo formula can then be given as Directional hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and bi hemispherical reflectance as white sky albedo These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface The albedos of planets satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties The study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos For example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids Enceladus a moon of Saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System with of EM radiation reflected Another notable high albedo body is Eris with an albedo of Many small objects in the outer Solar System and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds The overall albedo of the Moon is around but it is strongly directional and non Lambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the V band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the Bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected Their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion In detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces The correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is formula where formula is the astronomical albedo formula is the diameter in kilometers and formula is the absolute magnitude Although the albedo temperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on Earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year round illumination is greater The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between three and twelve degrees north The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation where areas such as the Sahara Desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation Tropical and sub tropical rain forest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes Albedo affects climate and drives weather All weather is a result of the uneven heating of Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos Essentially for the driving of weather there are two types of albedo regions on Earth Land and ocean Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of air masses depending on latitude and therefore insolation Warm and dry which form over tropical and sub tropical land masses warm and wet which form over tropical and sub tropical oceans cold and dry which form over temperate polar and sub polar land masses and cold and wet which form over temperate polar and sub polar oceans Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures and the masses develop into pressure systems High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere and south to north in the lower however due to the spinning of Earth the Coriolis effect further complicates flow and creates several weather climate bands and the jet streams When an area s albedo changes due to snowfall a snow temperature feedback results A layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling In principle if no outside temperature change affects this area e g a warm air mass the lowered albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback However because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating Albedo works on a smaller scale too In sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices PV For example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar PV technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon a Si H and crystalline silicon c Si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions Research showed impacts of over More recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven PV materials covering three common PV system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications Because forests are generally attributed a low albedo as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo Through the evapotranspiration of water trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy This water vapour rises resulting in cloud cover which also has a high albedo thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forests In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have a value of about to Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g Siberia were neutral or perhaps warming Snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow Over Antarctica they average a little more than If a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback Cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets Hence small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations see graph At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this At small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs incident angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles However as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light Note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities Fresh black ice exhibits Fresnel reflection Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near to a maximum approaching On any given day about half of Earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies Aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on Earth s radiative balance The direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain As per the effects are Another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles The size of this effect is difficult to quantify the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is W m with a range to W m Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo Human activities e g deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe However quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult Single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles It depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming radiation 
A A named a plural aes is the first letter and vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha from which it derives The upper case version consists of two more or less vertical lines joined at the top and crossed in their middle by a horizontal bar The earliest certain ancestor of A is aleph also called aleph the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet which by consisting entirely of consonants is an abjad rather than a true alphabet In turn the origin of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended In B C E the Phoenician alphabet s letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms Its name must have corresponded closely to the Hebrew or Arabic aleph When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for the glottal stop the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter and the sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel and gave it the similar name of alpha In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages dating to the th century BC the letter rests upon its side but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet used to write many languages including English During Roman times there were many variations on the letter A First was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent mediums For perishable surfaces what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes a cursive style was used Due to the perishable nature of the surfaces these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule There were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive The known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial At the termination of the Roman Empire th century AD several variants of the cursive minuscule appeared through Western Europe Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy the Merovingian script in France the Visigothic script in Spain and the Insular or Anglo Irish semi uncial or Anglo Saxon majuscule of Great Britain By the th century the Caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press This form was derived through a combining of prior forms th century Italy saw the formation of the two variants that are known today These variants the Italics and Roman forms were derived from the Caroline Script version The Italics form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke called Latin alpha or script a This slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of dark age Irish and English writers Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it Both derive from the majuscule capital form In Greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown Many fonts then made the right leg vertical In some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form In English orthography the letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds A by itself frequently denotes the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father its original Latin and Greek sound a closer further fronted sound as in hare which developed as the sound progressed from father to ace in concert with a later orthographic vowel the diphthong as in ace and major due to effects of the Great Vowel Shift the more rounded form in water or its closely related cousin found in was The double a sequence is not a native English combination however it occurs in some foreign words such as Aaron and aardvark A is the third most commonly used letter in English after E and T and the second most common in Spanish and French In one study on average about of letters used in English tend to be a while the number is in Spanish and in French In most languages that use the Latin alphabet A denotes an open unrounded vowel or An exception is Saanich in which A and A stands for a close mid front unrounded vowel In algebra the letter A along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet x y z are used to denote unknown quantities In geometry capital A B C etc are used to denote segments lines rays etc Also A is typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle In logic A is used to signify the universal affirmative In phonetic and phonemic notation A is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status A A or A the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork A grade for clean restaurants A list celebrities etc Such associations can have a motivating effect as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance when compared with other letters A is a common symbol of school and basic phonetics in the US along with B and C Finally the letter A is used to denote size as in a narrow size shoe or a small cup size in a brassiere
