Anarchism Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as self governed voluntary institutions but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non hierarchical free associations Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary or harmful While anti statism is central some argue that anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations including but not limited to the state system As a subtle and anti dogmatic philosophy anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy There are many types and traditions of anarchism not all of which are mutually exclusive Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications Anarchism is usually considered a radical left wing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarcho communism and anarcho syndicalism with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organisations Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression supporting self defense or non violence anarcho pacifism while others have supported the use of some coercive measures including violent revolution and propaganda of the deed on the path to an anarchist society The term anarchism is a compound word composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the Greek i e anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix an i e without and archos i e leader ruler cf archon or arkhe i e authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix izein The first known use of this word was in Anarchist was the term adopted by Maximilien de Robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of though among these anarchists there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs Pierre Joseph Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century Since the s from France the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the s in the United States its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States On the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th century BC among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan Zhuangzi s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist Zhuangzi wrote A petty thief is put in jail A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics their contemporary Zeno of Citium the founder of Stoicism also introduced similar topics Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition Georges Lechartier wrote that The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles In early Islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society Later some Muslim scholars such as Amer al Basri and Abu Hanifa led movements of boycotting the rulers paving the way to the awqaf endowments tradition which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry The French renaissance political philosopher Etienne de La Boetie wrote in his most famous work the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th century in England The term anarchist first entered the English language in during the English Civil War as a term of abuse used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents By the time of the French Revolution some such as the Enrages began to use the term positively in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic By the turn of the th century the English word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment particularly Jean Jacques Rousseau s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom As part of the political turmoil of the s in the wake of the French Revolution William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought Godwin was according to Peter Kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism He argued in Political Justice that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power Rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution His aversion to the imposition of a rules based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people s mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation In each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment The French Pierre Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work What is Property published in It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is Liberty is the mother not the daughter of order In What is Property Proudhon answers with the famous accusation Property is theft In this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriete where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish He contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use Later however Proudhon added that Property is Liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power His opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time The anarcho communist Joseph Dejacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian Unlike Pierre Joseph Proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature In in Germany the post hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book The Ego and Its Own which will later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism Anarchists active in the Revolution in France included Anselme Bellegarrigue Ernest Coeurderoy Joseph Dejacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon In Europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt In Spain Ramon de la Sagra established the anarchist journal El Porvenir in La Coruna in which was inspired by Proudhon s ideas The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon s works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party According to George Woodcock These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after but before that time Proudhonian ideas as interpreted by Pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early s According to the Encyclopedia Britannica During the Spanish revolution of Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized or cantonalist political system on Proudhonian lines In the International Workingmen s Association sometimes called the First International united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon Blanquists Philadelphes English trade unionists socialists and social democrats Due to its links to active workers movements the International became a significant organisation Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council Proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed Marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings In following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom LPF Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International which had decided not to get involved with the LPF They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property At first the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction Subsequently the International became polarised into two camps with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads Bakunin characterised Marx s ideas as centralist and predicted that if a Marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune and in the General Council called only a special conference in London One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy while a technical excuse that they had split away from the Federation Romande was used to avoid inviting Bakunin s Swiss supporters Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the General Council s resolutions passed almost unanimously Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers In the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York In response the federalist sections formed their own International at the St Imier Congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist program The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from March more formally from March to May The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco Prussian War Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune They included George Woodcock states The anti authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the State with the free and spontaneous organisation of labour In the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions FOTLU of the United States and Canada unanimously set May as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard In response unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event On May in Chicago a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd The next day May anarchists staged a rally at Chicago s Haymarket Square A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer In the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution The incident became known as the Haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day In a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair Although it had initially been conceived as a once off event by the following year the celebration of International Workers Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker s holiday In the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including Errico Malatesta Pierre Monatte Luigi Fabbri Benoit Broutchoux Emma Goldman Rudolf Rocker and Christiaan Cornelissen Various themes were treated during the Congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient He thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it The Spanish Workers Federation in was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain The most successful was the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo National Confederation of Labour CNT founded in Before the s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics attracting million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association a federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in with delegates representing two million workers from countries in Europe and Latin America In Latin America in particular The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America and until the early s most of the trade unions in Mexico Brazil Peru Chile and Argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the Spanish C N T as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions Some anarchists such as Johann Most advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda By the s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides From onwards the Russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society Moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt France s Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism However as soon as important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le Revolte that a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement The anarcho syndicalist Fernand Pelloutier argued in for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter State repression including the infamous French lois scelerates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the Paris Commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts Numerous heads of state were assassinated between and by members of the anarchist movement For example U S President McKinley s assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because international terrorism arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite This image remains to this day Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I and the October Revolution Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution However following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the Kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine There in the Free Territory they fought in the civil war against the Whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising before they left Russia Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised For them Bakunin s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements In France and the United States for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International The revolutionary wave of saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists Gustav Landauer Silvio Gesell and Erich Muhsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures In the Italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana grew to members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union members plus Umanita Nova its daily paper grew accordingly Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early s it lead a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho communist Ricardo Flores Magon In Paris the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles which included Nestor Makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism Their manifesto called the Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft was supported Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives In the s this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations In the s and s the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism s conflict with the state Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution In France where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February riots anarchists divided over a united front policy Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II In Germany the anarchist Erich Muhsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of February within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin Joseph Goebbels the Nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those Jewish subversives Over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg Brandenburg and finally Oranienburg On February Muhsam was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of July Muhsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning In Spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory But in the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power Months later the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War In response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land But even before the fascist victory in the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily Catalonia Aragon Andalusia and parts of the Levante Much of Spain s economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence as the Soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment Factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution which he claimed came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history Stalinist led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District In the early s the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociacion Libertaria de Cuba Cuban Libertarian Association From to the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new Communist regime In in France the Federation Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confederation nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist Federazione Anarchica Italiana was founded in Italy Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September and in the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May After World War II an appeal in the Fraye Arbeter Shtime detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them By February the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large scale operation The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ Die Freie Gesellschaft which survived until In the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded In the Anarcho Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation The Syndicalist Workers Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post war Britain and one of Solidarity Federation s earliest predecessors It was formed in by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain Unlike the AFB which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as Albert Camus Herbert Read Paul Goodman Dwight Macdonald Allen Ginsberg George Woodcock Leopold Kohr Julian Beck John Cage and the French Surrealist group led by Andre Breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Federation Anarchiste Anarcho pacifism became influential in the Anti nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho pacifists Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day Anarcho pacifism became a basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham s Volume Two The Emergence of the New Anarchism A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the s and s Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts In in Carrara Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in by the three existing European federations of France the Federation Anarchiste the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile In the United Kingdom in the s this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona Spain In Denmark squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen Since the revival of anarchism in the mid th century a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the s Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the st century formed by far the majority of anarchists Around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization WTO Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police These actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations the International Workers Association and International Libertarian Solidarity The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the Confederacion General del Trabajo CGT and the CNT CGT membership was estimated at around for Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho syndicalist Youth Federation the CNT AIT in France the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation and Anarchist Federation The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World claiming paying members and the International Workers Association an anarcho syndicalist successor to the First International also remain active Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty i e opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill recognizing equality of entitlement In a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid th century and after Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Marmol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms i e collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought Mutualism began in th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States Proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance For this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism Proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict In William Godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote Political Justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism Godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge Godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good An influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the German Max Stirner Stirner s The Ego and Its Own published in is a founding text of the philosophy According to Stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for God state or morality To Stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality Stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals Egoism has inspired many interpretations of Stirner s philosophy It was re discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist John Henry Mackay Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during The Peaceful Revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster It is apparent that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews William B Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form Henry David Thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe Thoreau was an American author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading transcendentalist He is best known for his books Walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay Civil Disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner s egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France These authors and activists included Oscar Wilde Emile Armand Han Ryner Henri Zisly Renzo Novatore Miguel Gimenez Igualada Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi among others Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion It is the largest school of thought in anarchism Social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid Collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised This was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production However collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society Anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a post revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need Anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom Most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society Anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro organisationalist and insurrectionary anti organisationalist sections To date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society i e established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution Russian Revolution Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War starting in anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of Francoismthe regime that won the war Adolf HitlerHitler Mussolini Spanish Communist Party repression backed by the USSR as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself During the Russian Revolution anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army

syndicalists view trade unionlabour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the State politystate with a new society democratically self managed by workers The basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are Workers wikt Solidaritysolidarity Direct action and Workers self management Anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position will allow workers to liberate themselves Moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society should be self managing They should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement He outlined a view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his pamphlet Anarcho Syndicalism The International

within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology Anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary Coercioncoercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised Free association communism and anarchismfree association Anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the State politystate In essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa L Susan Brown claims that as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist Anarcha feminism began with the late th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre Anarcho pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence It developed mostly in the Netherlands Britain and the United States before and during the Second World War Christian anarchism is a Christian movementmovement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity Its main proponents included Leo Tolstoy Dorothy Day Ammon Hennacy and Jacques Ellul Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda s Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft The document was based on the experiences of Anarchism in RussiaRussian anarchists in the October Revolution which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups The Platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement s failures during the Russian Revolution Russian Revolution Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives In the s this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists Voline and Sebastien Faure It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations Post left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism s relationship to traditional Left wing politics Some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist Situationist International post left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrectionary anarchisminsurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses Instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies Post anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought drawing from diverse ideas including post modernism autonomist marxism post left anarchy Situationist International and postcolonialism Left wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti corporatist anti hierarchical pro labor positions and anti capitalism in economics and anti imperialism in foreign policy Anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state politystate in favour of sovereign individualindividual sovereignty in a free market Anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from Austrian School economics study of law and economics and public choice theory There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons

anarchist theory Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory File Emilearmand jpgthumb pxFrench individualist anarchist Emile Armand who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century An important current within anarchism is free love Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as a clear direct expression of an individual s self ownership Free love particularly stressed women s rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood s The Word free loveThe Word Free Society as The Firebrand as Free Society was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries The publication advocated free love and women s rights and critiqued Comstockery censorship of sexual information Also M E Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love In New York City s Greenwich Village Bohemianismbohemian feminists and socialists advocated self realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical Edna St Vincent Millay and the lesbian anarchist Margaret Anderson were prominent among them Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman among others Magnus Hirschfeld noted in that Goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only American to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public In fact before Goldman heterosexual anarchist Robert Reitzel spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the s in his Detroit based German language journal Der arme Teufel In Argentina anarcha feminist Virginia Bolten published the newspaper called which was published nine times in Rosario between January and January and was revived briefly in In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality Mujeres Libres was an anarchist women s organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women It was founded in by Lucia Sanchez Saornil Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gascon and had approximately members The organisation was based on the idea of a double struggle for Feminist movementwomen s liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel In order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists Lucia Sanchez Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha feminist federation Mujeres Libres who was open about her lesbianism She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment More recently the British anarcho pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual The Joy of Sex The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray in such works as Theorie du corps amoureux pour une erotique solaire and L invention du plaisir fragments cyreaniques File Fransisco Ferrer Guardia jpgleftthumbFrancesc Ferrer i Guardia Catalan peopleCatalan anarchist pedagogue and Freethoughtfree thinker For English anarchist William Godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness For Godwin education had to have A respect for the child s autonomy which precluded any form of coercion A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child s own motivation and initiatives and A concern about the child s capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school In his Political Justice he criticises state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government Early American anarchist Josiah Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established Max Stirner wrote in a long essay on education called The False Principle of our Education In it Stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that self understanding consists in hourly self creation Education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment In the United States freethought was a basically Anti Christianityanti christian anti clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters A number of contributors to Liberty Liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co editor of Freethought and for a time The Truth Seeker E C Walker was co editor of the excellent free thought free love journal Lucifer the Light Bearer Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer the Light Bearer Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty Liberty The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself In Catalan anarchist and Freethoughtfree thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guardia established modern or Progressive educationprogressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church The schools stated goal was to Popular educationeducate the working class in a rational secular and non coercive setting Fiercely anti clerical Ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state Murray Bookchin wrote This period s was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence Perhaps the best known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer s Modern School Escuela Moderna a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally La Escuela Moderna and Ferrer s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of Modern School United StatesModern Schools in the United States Cuba South America and London The first of these was started in New York City in It also inspired the Italian newspaper Universita popolare Italian newspaperUniversita popolare founded in Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate Tolstoy s educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture He thought that Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself Education is culture under restraint culture is free Education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary For him without compulsion education was transformed into culture A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the anarchist free schoolfree school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches Experiments in Germany led to A S Neill founding what became Summerhill School in Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice However although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se The term deschooling was popularised by Ivan Illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead Criticisms of anarchism include moralitymoral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics European history professor Carl Landauer in his book European Socialism argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force He also argued that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity Category Anarchism

Autism Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction verbal and non verbal communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum ASDs the other two being Asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as PDD NOS which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations or by rare combinations of common genetic variants In rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes such as heavy metals pesticides or childhood vaccines the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence The prevalence of autism is about per people worldwide and it occurs about four times more often in boys than girls The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC report of children in the United States one in are diagnosed with ASD a increase from one in in The number of people diagnosed as autistic has been increasing dramatically since the s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life The signs usually develop gradually but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress Early behavioral cognitive or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self care social and communication skills Although there is no known cure there have been reported cases of children who recovered Not many autistic children live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful An autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior Other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis Autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ASD see Classification from other developmental disorders Autistic people have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on Mars Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as the deficiency to point at things Three to five year old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others However they do form attachments to their primary caregivers Most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than non autistic children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD Older autistic children and adults perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition Autistic children suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for autistic individuals For them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel Functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply There are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in autistic individuals The limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums A study interviewed parents of autistic children and reported that about two thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one third had a history of aggression with tantrums significantly more common than in non autistic children with language impairments A Swedish study found that of individuals aged or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis About a third to a half of autistic individuals do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver In the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations than other children their gestures are less often integrated with words Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish autistic infants for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language In a pair of studies autistic children aged performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference As people are often sized up initially according to their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals may be likely to overestimate their audience s level of comprehension Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised RBS R categorizes as follows No single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family An estimated to of autistic individuals show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants Many autistic individuals show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population Sensory abnormalities are found in over of autistic individuals and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders Differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements An estimated of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of autistic children to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator Selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition Although some autistic children also have gastrointestinal GI symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear Parents of autistic children have higher levels of stress Siblings of autistic children report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship However they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome siblings of autistic individuals have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms However there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA but are heritable and influence gene expression Studies of twins suggest that heritability is for autism and as high as for ASD and siblings of those with autism are about times more likely to be autistic than the general population However most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified Typically autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD Numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis Hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes All known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies extensive searches are underway Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease heavy metals solvents diesel exhaust PCBs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress although no links have been found and some have been completely disproven Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the MMR vaccine for causing autism The latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children Autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain How autism occurs is not well understood Its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies Unlike many other brain disorders such as Parkinson s autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors Just after birth the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response Aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is possibly part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD Although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autism s processes As autoantibodies are found in conditions other than ASD and are not always present in ASD the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors Also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than of cases The mirror neuron system MNS theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action The MNS may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of autistic individuals delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in autistic children However autistic individuals also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object ASD related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a large scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the task positive network used in sustained attention and goal directed thinking In autistic people the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of self referential thought A brain imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in autistic individuals The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that autistic adults have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex From studies based on event related potentials transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli For example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals In the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with q deletion syndrome Research on autism schizophrenia relations for chromosome q chromosome p and chromosome p are inconclusive Two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition Simon Baron Cohen s empathizing systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents An extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing These theories are somewhat related to Baron Cohen s earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children s atypical responses to the Sally Anne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis However most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition In his review Kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people A related theory enhanced perceptual functioning focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism Neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful Diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism Autism is defined in the DSM IV TR as exhibiting at least six symptoms total including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects Onset must be prior to age three years with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder ICD uses essentially the same definition Several diagnostic instruments are available Two are commonly used in autism research the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised ADI R is a semistructured parent interview and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS uses observation and interaction with the child The Childhood Autism Rating Scale CARS is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child If warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as Landau Kleffner syndrome The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile X testing A genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations As new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice A US study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was years far above recommendations and that of children remained undiagnosed at age years Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms Conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders PDD which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior These symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance Of the five PDD forms Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes PDD not otherwise specified PDD NOS also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder Unlike with autism people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development The terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism Asperger syndrome and PDD NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders ASD or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism In this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism ASD and PDD are often used interchangeably ASD in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication Because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism LFA MFA and HFA based on IQ thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial Autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than autistic individuals the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome HFA and non syndromal autism is unclear Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from to months of age The validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior About half of parents of autistic children notice their child s unusual behaviors by age months and about four fifths notice by age months According to an article in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome US and Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at and months using autism specific formal screening tests In contrast in the UK children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened It is not known which approach is more effective Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers M CHAT the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire and the First Year Inventory initial data on M CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders Screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features The main goals when treating autistic children are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options Intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated Available approaches include applied behavior analysis ABA developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention an early intervention model for to hours a week for multiple years is an effective behavioral treatment for some autistic children Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails More than half of US children diagnosed as autistic are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics Aside from antipsychotics Both aripiprazole and risperidone are effective for treating irritability in children with autistic disorders there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for autistic adolescents and adults An autistic person may respond atypically to medications the medications can have adverse effects and no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism Although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk A study found that compared to their peers autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein free diets in botched chelation therapy killed a five year old autistic child Treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so For someone born in a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of net present value in dollars inflation adjusted from estimate with about medical care extra education and other care and lost economic productivity Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child and unreimbursed out of pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems one US study found a average loss of annual income in families of autistic children and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance After childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning There is no known cure Children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not It is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples of autistic children have ranged from to Most autistic children can acquire language by age or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years Most autistic children lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination Although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age Few high quality studies address long term prognosis Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife Acquiring language before age six having an IQ above and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism A British study of adults who were diagnosed before as autistic children with IQ above found that achieved a high level of independence as adults had some friends and were generally in work but required some support had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in ASD with a high level of support and very limited autonomy and needed high level hospital care A Swedish study of adults that did not exclude low IQ found worse prognosis for example only achieved independence A Canadian study of young adults diagnosed as autistic as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor fair good and very good of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives mostly in volunteer sheltered or part time work Changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children Most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of per for autism and close to per for ASD and per children in the United States for ASD as of because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate ASD s true prevalence PDD NOS s prevalence has been estimated at per Asperger syndrome at roughly per and childhood disintegrative disorder at per The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the s and early s This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls The sex ratio averages and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to with intellectual disability and more than without Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism Most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism Several other conditions are common in autistic children They include A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named The Table Talk of Martin Luther compiled by his notetaker Mathesius contains the story of a year old boy who may have been severely autistic Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report The earliest well documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue as detailed in a court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair s marriage to gain Blair s inheritance The Wild Boy of Aveyron a feral child caught in showed several signs of autism the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation The New Latin word autismus English translation autism was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia He derived it from the Greek word autos meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance The word autism first took its modern sense in when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a report of children with striking behavioral similarities Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger Kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mothers Starting in the late s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy As late as the mid s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children s behaviors are perceived negatively by others and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being 
Albedo Albedo or reflection coefficient derived from Latin albedo whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface It is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it Its dimensionless nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to for perfect reflection of a white surface Albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation When quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light In general the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation except for Lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution In practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function BRDF may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface but albedo is very useful as a first approximation The albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and calculating reflectivity of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings The average overall albedo of Earth its planetary albedo is to because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features The term was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his work Photometria Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body When seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms Most land areas are in an albedo range of to The average albedo of the Earth is about This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds Earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA s MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g Earth s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about C If Earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below C If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about C In contrast if the entire Earth is covered by water a so called aquaplanet the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under C It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle formula and the bi hemispherical reflectance formula the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination formula Albedo formula can then be given as Directional hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and bi hemispherical reflectance as white sky albedo These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface The albedos of planets satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties The study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos For example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids Enceladus a moon of Saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System with of EM radiation reflected Another notable high albedo body is Eris with an albedo of Many small objects in the outer Solar System and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds The overall albedo of the Moon is around but it is strongly directional and non Lambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the V band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the Bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected Their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion In detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces The correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is formula where formula is the astronomical albedo formula is the diameter in kilometers and formula is the absolute magnitude Although the albedo temperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on Earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year round illumination is greater The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between three and twelve degrees north The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation where areas such as the Sahara Desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation Tropical and sub tropical rain forest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes Albedo affects climate and drives weather All weather is a result of the uneven heating of Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos Essentially for the driving of weather there are two types of albedo regions on Earth Land and ocean Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of air masses depending on latitude and therefore insolation Warm and dry which form over tropical and sub tropical land masses warm and wet which form over tropical and sub tropical oceans cold and dry which form over temperate polar and sub polar land masses and cold and wet which form over temperate polar and sub polar oceans Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures and the masses develop into pressure systems High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere and south to north in the lower however due to the spinning of Earth the Coriolis effect further complicates flow and creates several weather climate bands and the jet streams When an area s albedo changes due to snowfall a snow temperature feedback results A layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling In principle if no outside temperature change affects this area e g a warm air mass the lowered albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback However because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating Albedo works on a smaller scale too In sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices PV For example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar PV technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon a Si H and crystalline silicon c Si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions Research showed impacts of over More recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven PV materials covering three common PV system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications Because forests are generally attributed a low albedo as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo Through the evapotranspiration of water trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy This water vapour rises resulting in cloud cover which also has a high albedo thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forests In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have a value of about to Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g Siberia were neutral or perhaps warming Snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow Over Antarctica they average a little more than If a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback Cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets Hence small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations see graph At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this At small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs incident angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles However as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light Note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities Fresh black ice exhibits Fresnel reflection Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near to a maximum approaching On any given day about half of Earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies Aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on Earth s radiative balance The direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain As per the effects are Another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles The size of this effect is difficult to quantify the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is W m with a range to W m Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo Human activities e g deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe However quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult Single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles It depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming radiation 
A A named a plural aes is the first letter and vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha from which it derives The upper case version consists of two more or less vertical lines joined at the top and crossed in their middle by a horizontal bar The earliest certain ancestor of A is aleph also called aleph the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet which by consisting entirely of consonants is an abjad rather than a true alphabet In turn the origin of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended In B C E the Phoenician alphabet s letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms Its name must have corresponded closely to the Hebrew or Arabic aleph When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for the glottal stop the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter and the sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel and gave it the similar name of alpha In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages dating to the th century BC the letter rests upon its side but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet used to write many languages including English During Roman times there were many variations on the letter A First was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent mediums For perishable surfaces what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes a cursive style was used Due to the perishable nature of the surfaces these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule There were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive The known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial At the termination of the Roman Empire th century AD several variants of the cursive minuscule appeared through Western Europe Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy the Merovingian script in France the Visigothic script in Spain and the Insular or Anglo Irish semi uncial or Anglo Saxon majuscule of Great Britain By the th century the Caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press This form was derived through a combining of prior forms th century Italy saw the formation of the two variants that are known today These variants the Italics and Roman forms were derived from the Caroline Script version The Italics form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke called Latin alpha or script a This slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of dark age Irish and English writers Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it Both derive from the majuscule capital form In Greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown Many fonts then made the right leg vertical In some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form In English orthography the letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds A by itself frequently denotes the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father its original Latin and Greek sound a closer further fronted sound as in hare which developed as the sound progressed from father to ace in concert with a later orthographic vowel the diphthong as in ace and major due to effects of the Great Vowel Shift the more rounded form in water or its closely related cousin found in was The double a sequence is not a native English combination however it occurs in some foreign words such as Aaron and aardvark A is the third most commonly used letter in English after E and T and the second most common in Spanish and French In one study on average about of letters used in English tend to be a while the number is in Spanish and in French In most languages that use the Latin alphabet A denotes an open unrounded vowel or An exception is Saanich in which A and A stands for a close mid front unrounded vowel In algebra the letter A along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet x y z are used to denote unknown quantities In geometry capital A B C etc are used to denote segments lines rays etc Also A is typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle In logic A is used to signify the universal affirmative In phonetic and phonemic notation A is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status A A or A the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork A grade for clean restaurants A list celebrities etc Such associations can have a motivating effect as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance when compared with other letters A is a common symbol of school and basic phonetics in the US along with B and C Finally the letter A is used to denote size as in a narrow size shoe or a small cup size in a brassiere 
Alabama Alabama is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States It is bordered by Tennessee to the north Georgia to the east Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south and Mississippi to the west Alabama is the th most extensive and the rd most populous of the United States At Alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation From the American Civil War until World War II Alabama like many Southern states suffered economic hardship in part because of continued dependence on agriculture Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers White rural interests dominated the state legislature until the s while urban interests and African Americans were under represented African Americans and poor whites were essentially disfranchised in a status that continued into the s Following World War II Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests The establishment or expansion of multiple United States Armed Forces installations added to the state economy and helped bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid th century The state economy in the st century is dependent on management automotive finance manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the Yellowhammer State after the state bird Alabama is also known as the Heart of Dixie and the Cotton State The state tree is the Longleaf Pine and the state flower is the Camellia The capital of Alabama is Montgomery The largest city by population is Birmingham and largest city by total land area is Huntsville The oldest city is Mobile founded by French colonists The European American naming of the Alabama River and state originates from the Alabama people a Muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river In the Alabama language the word for an Alabama person is Albaamo or variously Albaama or Albaamo in different dialects the plural form is Albaamaha The word Alabama is believed to have come from the related Choctaw language and was adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name The spelling of the word varies significantly among historical sources The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of with Garcilaso de la Vega using Alibamo while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu respectively in efforts to transliterate the term As early as the French called the tribe the Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Riviere des Alibamons Other spellings of the appellation have included Alibamu Alabamo Albama Alebamon Alibama Alibamou Alabamu and Allibamou Sources disagree on the meaning of the word An article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed that it meant Here We Rest This notion was popularized in the s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek Experts in the Muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather The meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants The state has numerous place names of Native American origin Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization Trade with the northeastern tribes via the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period BC AD and continued until European contact The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from to AD with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville Alabama Analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex SECC Contrary to popular belief the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee an Iroquoian language people and the Muskogean speaking Alabama Alibamu Chickasaw Choctaw Creek and Koasati While part of the same large language family the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages With exploration in the th century the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in More than years later the French founded the first European settlement in the region at Old Mobile in The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in This area was claimed by the French from to as part of La Louisiane After the French lost to the British in the Seven Years War it became part of British West Florida from to After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War the territory was divided between the United States and Spain The latter retained control of this western territory from until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U S forces on April Thomas Bassett a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era was one of the earliest White settlers in the state outside Mobile He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early s The boundaries of the district were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County northernmost Mobile County and most of Washington County What is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in part of the independent Republic of West Florida in and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in Most of what is now the northern two thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from onwards Following the Revolutionary War it remained a part of Georgia although heavily disputed With the exception of the immediate area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands what is now the lower one third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in following the Yazoo land scandal Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams Onis Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in Prior to the admission of Mississippi as a state on December the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory The Alabama Territory was created by the United States Congress on March St Stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from to The U S Congress selected Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the nd state From July to August delegates met to prepare the new state constitution Huntsville served as the temporary capital of Alabama from to when the seat of state government was moved to Cahaba in Dallas County Cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from to Alabama Fever was already underway when the state was admitted to the Union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation Part of the frontier in the s and s its constitution provided for universal suffrage for White men Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded The economy of the central Black Belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew largely from slave labor The area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers Alabama had a population estimated at under people in but it had increased to more than people by Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in From to Tuscaloosa served as the capital of Alabama On January the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery The first legislative session in the new capital met in December A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia The first structure burned down in but was rebuilt on the same site in This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter Maine By the population had increased to a total of people of which nearly half were enslaved African Americans and were free people of color On January Alabama declared its secession from the Union After remaining an independent republic for a few days it joined the Confederate States of America The Confederacy s capital was initially located at Montgomery Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state Alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville Alabama joined Nathan Bedford Forrest s battalion in Hopkinsville Kentucky The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails This led to them being greeted with Yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army Alabama s slaves were freed by the th Amendment in Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May until its official restoration to the Union in From to with most White citizens barred temporarily from voting many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African American congressmen Jeremiah Haralson Benjamin S Turner and James T Rapier Following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton During Reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in that created the state s first public school system and expanded women s rights Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation Organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans Besides the short lived original Ku Klux Klan these included the Pale Faces Knights of the White Camellia Red Shirts and the White League Reconstruction in Alabama ended in when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor s office They wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools The same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools Railroad passenger cars were segregated in Alabama passed more Jim Crow laws at the beginning of the th century to further encourage segregation in everyday life The new Constitution of Alabama included electoral laws that effectively disfranchised African Americans Native Americans and most poor Whites through voting restrictions including poll taxes and literacy test requirements While the planter class had persuaded poor Whites to support these legislative efforts the new restrictions resulted in their disfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax In Alabama had more than African Americans eligible to vote By only were qualified to register although at least African American voters were literate By more White Alabamians than African American residents had been disfranchised a total of Whites to African Americans Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote a situation that persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens The constitution reiterated that schools be racially segregated It also restated that interracial marriage was illegal although such marriages had been made illegal in Further racial segregation laws were passed related to public facilities into the s jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in The rural dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs The local community and state raised matching funds to pay the rest Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas Beginning in the first Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African American children A total of schools seven teacher s houses and several vocational buildings had been completed in the state by Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places Continued racial discrimination agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities They left Alabama in the early th century as part of the Great Migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern and midwestern industrial cities Reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in Alabama see Historical Populations table below dropped by nearly half from to At the same time many rural people both White and African American moved to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called The Magic City By the s Birmingham was the th largest city in the United States and had more than of the Alabama s population Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy Its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict to recognize demographic changes such as urbanization Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the Civil War Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living One example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in Mobile Between and more than people moved into the city to work for war effort industries Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base Despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas In addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham One result was that Jefferson County containing Birmingham s industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature A study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons but they were disfranchised White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with White voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs Although efforts had already started decades earlier African Americans began to press to end disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the s and s with the Civil Rights Movement In the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown v Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated but Alabama was slow to comply The civil rights movement raised national awareness of the issues leading to the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of and Voting Rights Act of by the U S Congress During the s under Governor George Wallace Alabama attempted but failed to resist compliance with federal demands for desegregation During the Civil Rights Movement African Americans achieved enforcement of voting and other civil constitutional rights through the passage of the national Civil Rights Act of and the Voting Rights Act of Legal segregation ended in the states as Jim Crow laws were invalidated or repealed Under the Voting Rights Act of cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature In for the first time since the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution s provision for periodic redistricting based on population This benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than years Alabama is the thirtieth largest state in the United States with of total area of the area is water making Alabama rd in the amount of surface water also giving it

south of Haleyville A wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County just north of Montgomery This is the Wetumpka crater the site of Alabama s greatest natural disaster A wide meteorite hit the area about million years ago The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme star wound because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface In Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry

deaths from lightning strikes per capita Alabama along with Oklahoma has the most reported EF tornadoes of any state according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January to June Several long tracked F tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state even surpassing Texas which has a much larger area within Tornado Alley The state suffered tremendous damage in the Super Outbreak of April and the April tornado outbreak The outbreak in April produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state The tally reached The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December along with the spring severe weather season The northern part of the state along the Tennessee Valley is one of the areas in the U S most vulnerable to violent tornadoes The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Dixie Alley as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains Winters are generally mild in Alabama as they are throughout most of the southeastern U S with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a

American English Irish German and Scots Irish Those citing American ancestry in Alabama are generally of English or British ancestry many Anglo Americans identify as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long in some cases since the s Demographers estimate that a minimum of of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and that the figure is likely higher In the census of the people in Alabama identified as being of English ancestry making them the largest ethnic group at the time Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots Irish origins than self reported Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots Irish but based on historic immigration and settlement their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots Irish coming from northern Ireland where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization The Scots Irish were the largest non English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution and many settled in the South later moving into the Deep South as it was developed In under the Davis Strong Act the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation the Native American peoples who have sometimes been of mixed race have insisted on having their cultural identification respected In the past their self identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black The state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast These are The state government has promoted

amendments and words it is the world s longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the U S Constitution There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama s constitution Critics suggest that Alabama s constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism Alabama s government is divided into three equal branches The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives with members and the Alabama Senate with members The Legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority most state Legislatures require a two thirds majority to override a veto The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws It is headed by the Governor of Alabama Other members of executive branch include the cabinet the Attorney General of Alabama the Alabama Secretary of State the Alabama State Treasurer and the State Auditor of Alabama The current governor of the state is Republican Robert Bentley The lieutenant governor is Republican Kay Ivey The judicial branch

ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country Property taxes are the lowest in the U S The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes Since Alabama s tax structure largely depends on consumer spending it is subject to high variable budget structure For example in Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as million Alabama has counties Each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission which normally also has executive authority in the county Because of the restraints placed in the Alabama Constitution all but seven counties Jefferson Lee Mobile Madison Montgomery Shelby and Tuscaloosa in the state have little to no home rule Instead most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning On November Jefferson County declared bankruptcy Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state The state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol Some counties and municipalities are dry which bans all sales of alcohol in those areas During Reconstruction following the American Civil War Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope In the political coalition known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans in part by suppressing the African American vote After a coalition of White politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents a process completed in provisions of the constitution Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor Whites however By more Whites than African Americans had been disfranchised to although the impact was greater on the African American community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law From through the s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the s and s during the American Civil Rights Movement when racist Whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform Democrat George Wallace the state s only four term governor was a controversial figure Only with the passage of the Federal Civil Rights Act of and Voting Rights Act of did African Americans regain suffrage among other civil rights In the Alabama Legislature passed and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact In a symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America In Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in years With the disfranchisement of African Americans the state became part of the Solid South a system in which the Democratic Party became essentially the only political party in every Southern state For nearly years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election Republicans hold all nine seats on the Alabama Supreme Court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts Until no Republicans held any of the court seats This change also began likely in part due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in In that general election the then incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama Ernest C Hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately votes to Republican Perry O Hooper Sr Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education In Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in years Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction one is Kay Ivey the current Lieutenant Governor Many local offices County Commissioners Boards of Education Tax Assessors Tax Collectors etc in the state are still held by Democrats Local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the Republican Primary although there are exceptions Alabama s County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts The current split is Democrats Republicans and one Independent Choctaw However most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republican sheriffs preside over more urban suburban and heavily populated counties Two Alabama counties Montgomery and Calhoun with a population of over have Democratic sheriffs and five Alabama counties with a population of under have Republican sheriffs Autauga Coffee Dale Coosa and Blount As of the state of Alabama has one female sheriff in Morgan County Alabama and nine African American sheriffs The state s two U S senators are Jefferson B Sessions III and Richard C Shelby both Republicans Shelby was originally elected to the

Achilles In Greek mythology Achilles Akhilleus was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer s Iliad Achilles was said to be a demigod his mother was the nymph Thetis and his father Peleus was the king of the Myrmidons Achilles most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris who shot him in the heel with an arrow Later legends beginning with a poem by Statius in the st century AD state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel Because of his death from a small wound in the heel the term Achilles heel has come to mean a person s point of weakness Achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of akhos grief and Laos a people tribe nation etc In other words Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad frequently by Achilles Achilles role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of kleos glory usually glory in war Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy following Leonard Palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster With this derivation the name would have a double meaning in the poem When the hero is functioning rightly his men bring grief to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the th century BC It was also turned into the female form Achilleia attested in Attica in the th century BC IG II and in the form Achillia on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an Amazon Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus the king of the Myrmidons Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus the fore thinker warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father For this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed Peleus There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in Argonautica iv Zeus sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus that Thetis was so loyal to Hera s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him Thetis although a daughter of the sea god Nereus was also brought up by Hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus According to the Achilleid written by Statius in the st century AD and to no surviving previous sources when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx However he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his heel see Achilles heel Achilles tendon It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier In another version of this story Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage However none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability To the contrary in the Iliad Homer mentions Achilles being wounded in Book the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus son of Pelagon challenged Achilles by the river Scamander He cast two spears at once one grazed Achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood Also in the fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle in which we can find description of the hero s death Cypria unknown author Aithiopis by Arctinus of Miletus Little Iliad by Lesche of Mytilene Iliou persis by Arctinus of Miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness heel in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles death the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his body Peleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur on Mt Pelion to be reared The first two lines of the Iliad read Achilles consuming rage is at times wavering but at other times he cannot be cooled The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative According to the Iliad Achilles arrived at Troy with ships each carrying Myrmidons Book He appointed five leaders each leader commanding Myrmidons Menesthius Eudorus Peisander Phoenix and Alcimedon Book When the Greeks left for the Trojan War they accidentally stopped in Mysia ruled by King Telephus In the resulting battle Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal Telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal Guided by the oracle he arrived at Argos where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy According to other reports in Euripides lost play about Telephus he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound Achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge Alternatively Telephus held Orestes for ransom the ransom being Achilles aid in healing the wound Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed According to the Cypria the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles Wrath when the Achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by Achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas sacked neighboring cities and killed Troilus In Dares Phrygius Account of the Destruction of Troy the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe Troilus was a young Trojan prince the youngest of King Priam s or sometimes Apollo and Hecuba s five legitimate sons Despite his youth he was one of the main Trojan war leaders Prophecies linked Troilus fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him Yet Achilles struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of Apollo Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace In this version of the myth Achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents Had Troilus lived to adulthood the First Vatican Mythographer claimed Troy would have been invincible Homer s Iliad is the most famous narrative of Achilles deeds in the Trojan War Achilles wrath is the central theme of the poem The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war and does not narrate Achilles death It begins with Achilles withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by Agamemnon the commander of the Achaean forces Agamemnon had taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave Her father Chryses a priest of Apollo begs Agamemnon to return her to him Agamemnon refuses and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks The prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him Achilles does so and Calchas declares Chryseis must be returned to her father Agamemnon consents but then commands that Achilles battle prize Briseis be brought to him to replace Chryseis Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loved Briseis with the urging of his mother Thetis Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces At this same time burning with rage over Agamemnon s theft Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honor As the battle turns against the Greeks thanks to the influence of Zeus Nestor declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior Agamemnon agrees and sent Odysseus and two other chieftains Ajax and Phoenix to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do The Trojans led by Hector subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle wearing Achilles armor though Achilles remains at his camp Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus the son of Nestor Achilles grieves over his beloved companion s death and holds many funeral games in his honor His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles She persuades Hephaestus to make new armor for him in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector The new armor includes the Shield of Achilles described in great detail in the poem Enraged over the death of Patroclus Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector Achilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander who becomes angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Hera and Hephaestus Zeus himself takes note of Achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time alloted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself Finally Achilles finds his prey Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena in the form of Hector s favorite and dearest brother Deiphobus persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face After Hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable Wanting to go down fighting he charges at Achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses Accepting his fate Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused me Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse behind his chariot during Patroclus funeral games With the assistance of the god Hermes Hector s father Priam goes to Achilles tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector s body so that he can be buried Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral The poem ends with a description of Hector s funeral with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come Achilles after his temporary truce with Priam fought and killed the Amazonian warrior queen Penthesilea but later grieved over her death At first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her As he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty a notorious Greek jeerer by the name of Thersites laughed and mocked the great Achilles Following the death of Patroclus Achilles closest companion was Nestor s son Antilochus When Memnon king of Ethiopia slew Antilochus Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield killing Memnon The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus except that Memnon unlike Hector was also the son of a goddess Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the Iliad s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles reaction to it The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic Aethiopis which was composed after the Iliad possibly in the th century B C The Aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors The death of Achilles as predicted by Hector with his dying breath was brought about by Paris with an arrow to the heel according to Statius In some versions the god Apollo guided Paris arrow Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield His bones were mingled with those of Patroclus and funeral games were held He was represented in the Aethiopis as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube Another version of Achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses Polyxena Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena s hand in marriage Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world s greatest warrior But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles Paris who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow killing him Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles Achilles armor was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax Ajax the greater They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus Furious Ajax cursed Odysseus which earned the ire of Athena Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades After a while when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide Odysseus eventually gave the armor to Neoptolemus the son of Achilles A relic claimed to be Achilles bronze headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis Lycia a port on the Pamphylian Gulf The city was visited in BC by Alexander the Great who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the Iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear But it was being shown in the time of Pausanias in the nd century AD The exact nature of Achilles relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times In the Iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship but commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures In th century BC Athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of paiderasteia In Plato s Symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women Although epic decorum excluded explicit sexuality the Iliad indicates that Achilles had sexual relations with women with no direct evidence of sexual behaviors with Patroclus There was an archaic heroic cult of Achilles on the White Island Leuce in the Black Sea off the modern coasts of Romania and Ukraine with a temple and an oracle which survived into the Roman period In the lost epic Aithiopis a continuation of the Iliad attributed to Arktinus of Miletos Achilles mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube There the Achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games Pliny s Natural History mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara on the island consecrated to him located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from Peuce by the Danube Delta and the temple there Pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame In this island there is also Achilles temple and his statue Ruins of a square temple meters to a side possibly that dedicated to Achilles were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island Pomponius Mela tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea between Boristhene and Ister The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia who lived at the time of Domitian writes that the island was called Leuce because the wild animals which live there are white It is said that there in Leuce island reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor The Periplus of the Euxine Sea gives the following details It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea for her son Achilles who dwells there Here is his temple and his statue an archaic work This island is not inhabited and goats graze on it not many which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships sacrifice to Achilles In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts craters rings and precious stones offered to Achilles in gratitude One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin in which Achilles is praised and celebrated Some of these are worded in Patroclus honor because those who wish to be favored by Achilles honor Patroclus at the same time There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds which look after Achilles temple Every morning they fly out to sea wet their wings with water and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it And after they finish the sprinkling they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings Other people say still more that some of the men who reach this island come here intentionally They bring animals in their ships destined to be sacrificed Some of these animals they slaughter others they set free on the island in Achilles honor But there are others who are forced to come to this island by sea storms As they have no sacrificial animals but wish to get them from the god of the island himself they consult Achilles oracle They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair But in case the oracle denies them permission because there is an oracle here they add something to the price offered and if the oracle refuses again they add something more until at last the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient And then the victim doesn t run away any more but waits willingly to be caught So there is a great quantity of silver there consecrated to the hero as price for the sacrificial victims To some of the people who come to this island Achilles appears in dreams to others he would appear even during their navigation if they were not too far away and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships quoted in Densusianu The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity not only along the sea lanes of the Pontic Sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as Pontarches the lord and master of the Pontic Sea the protector of sailors and navigation Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters Achilleion in Messenia Stephanus Byzantinus Achilleios in Laconia Pausanias III Nicolae Densusianu Densusianu even though he recognized Achilles in the name of Aquileia and in the north arm of the Danube delta the arm of Chilia Achileii though his conclusion that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos evokes modern rather than archaic sea law Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing Pausanias III reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound Ammianus Marcellinus XXII attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island In the region of Gastouri to the south of the city of Corfu Greece Empress of Austria Elisabeth of Bavaria also known as Sissi built in a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to platonic romanticism The palace naturally was named after Achilles Achilleion This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the Trojan war Some post Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war Thetis or in some versions Peleus hides the young man at the court of Lycomedes king of Skyros There Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name Pyrrha the red haired girl With Lycomedes daughter Deidamia whom in the account of Statius he rapes Achilles there fathers a son Neoptolemus also called Pyrrhus after his father s possible alias According to this story Odysseus learns from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles aid Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women s clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods When Achilles instantly takes up the spear Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign In another version of the story Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes women while the women flee in panic Achilles prepares to defend the court thus giving his identity away In book of Homer s Odyssey Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades One of these is Achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son s exploits in the Trojan war and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus heroic actions Achilles is filled with satisfaction This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life Achilles was worshipped as a sea god in many of the Greek colonies on the Black Sea the location of the mythical White Island which he was said to inhabit after his death together with many other heroes The kings of the Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son Neoptolemus Alexander the Great son of the Epirote princess Olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at Achilleion while passing Troy In AD the Roman Emperor Caracalla while on his way to war against Parthia emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles tumulus Achilles fought and killed the Amazon Helene Some also said he married Medea and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius Argonautica In some versions of the myth Achilles has a relationship with his captive Briseis The Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles given the title Achilleis by modern scholars The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel Extant fragments of the Achilleis and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play The first part of the Achilleis trilogy The Myrmidons focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon only a few lines survive today In Plato s Symposium Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him The tragedian Sophocles also wrote The Lovers of Achilles a play with Achilles as the main character Only a few fragments survive The philosopher Zeno of Elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed Achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions The role of Achilles has been played in film by Achilles has frequently been mentioned in music

landowners or not He was known for his free soil stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism He first articulated this in saying The Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils His stance closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa From the early s Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in to be

introducing his Spot Resolutions The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U S Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it the national papers ignored it and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty Lincoln Lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on the presidential war making powers Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency Lincoln who had pledged in to serve only one term in the House supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the presidential election Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival Justin Butterfield considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer but in Lincoln s view an old fossil The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield handling every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer Twice a year for years weeks at a time he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation s western expansion particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges As a riverboat man Lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him In fact he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge In he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water The idea was never commercialized but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent In he represented the Alton Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders James A Barret who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret s pledge the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer superior and less expensive route and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret s payment The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in cases in as sole counsel of which were decided in his favor From to another of Lincoln s largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad Lincoln s most notable criminal trial occurred in when he defended William Duff Armstrong who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker The case is famous for Lincoln s use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight Lincoln produced a Farmers Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility Based on this evidence Armstrong was acquitted Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom but in an case where he defended a cousin Peachy Harrison who was accused of stabbing another to death Lincoln angrily protested the judge s decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected the judge a Democrat reversed his ruling allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison By the s slavery was still legal in the southern United States but had been generally outlawed in the northern states including Illinois whose original Constitution forbade slavery as required by the Northwest Ordinance Lincoln disapproved of slavery and the spread of slavery to new U S territory in the west He returned to politics to oppose the pro slavery Kansas Nebraska Act this law repealed the slavery restricting Missouri Compromise Senior Senator Stephen A Douglas of Illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty into the Act Douglas provision which Lincoln opposed specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U S territory rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress Eric Foner contrasts the abolitionists and anti slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers especially the equality of all men and democratic self government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence On October in his Peoria Speech Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency Speaking in his Kentucky accent with a very powerful voice he said the Kansas Act had a declared indifference but as I must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery I cannot but hate it I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world In late Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U S Senate seat from Illinois At that time senators were elected by the state legislature After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly his support began to dwindle and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull who defeated opponent Joel Aldrich Matteson The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas Nebraska Act Lincoln wrote I think I am a Whig but others say there are no Whigs and that I am an abolitionist I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party and on disenchanted Free Soil Liberty and Democratic Party members he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party At the Republican National Convention Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party s candidate for vice president In Douglas broke with President James Buchanan leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state In March the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dred Scott v Sandford Chief Justice Roger B Taney opined that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution Lincoln denounced the decision alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power Lincoln argued The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended to say all were equal in color size intellect moral developments or social capacity but they did consider all men created equal equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U S Senate in Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech drawing on A house divided against itself cannot stand I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free I do not expect the Union to be dissolved I do not expect the house to fall but I do expect it will cease to be divided It will become all one thing or all the other The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied Republicans across the North The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would in turn select Lincoln or Douglas as its U S senator The Senate campaign featured the seven Lincoln Douglas debates of the most famous political debates in American history The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically Lincoln warned that The Slave Power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands Lincoln stated Douglas popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation s morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U S Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the Democrats won more seats and the legislature re elected Douglas to the Senate Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation In May Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats Anzeiger a German language newspaper which was consistently supportive most of the state s German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German language paper could mobilize On February New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong Despite his inelegant appearance many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination Journalist Noah Brooks reported No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience Historian Donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival s William H Seward own state at an event sponsored by the second rival s Salmon P Chase loyalists while not mentioning either by name during its delivery In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions Lincoln said The taste is in my mouth a little On May the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur Lincoln s followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis Norman Judd Leonard Swett and Jesse DuBois and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax Lincoln s supporters adopted the label of The Rail Candidate On May at the Republican National Convention in Chicago Lincoln s friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as William H Seward and Salmon P Chase A former Democrat Hannibal Hamlin of Maine was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket Lincoln s success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs Lincoln s managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others while following Lincoln s strong dictate to Make no contracts that bind me Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the Dred Scott decision and the presidency of James Buchanan Throughout the s Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession Meanwhile Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats Delegates from slave states walked out of the Democratic convention disagreeing with Douglas position on popular sovereignty and ultimately selected John C Breckinridge as their candidate As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches Instead he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform and second on Lincoln s life story emphasizing his childhood poverty The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts The Republican Party s production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln s life and sold to copies On November Lincoln was elected the th president of the United States beating Democrat Stephen A Douglas John C Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party He was the first president from the Republican Party His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West no ballots were cast for him in of the Southern slave states and he won only two of counties in all the Southern states Lincoln received votes Douglas votes Breckinridge votes and Bell votes Turnout was percent with Lincoln winning the free Northern states as well as California and Oregon Douglas won Missouri and split New Jersey with Lincoln Bell won Virginia Tennessee and Kentucky and Breckinridge won the rest of the South Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote his victory in the electoral college was decisive Lincoln had and his opponents added together had only There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln s opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York New Jersey and Rhode Island but even if the anti Lincoln vote had been combined in every state Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College As Lincoln s election became evident secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March On December South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by February Florida Mississippi Alabama Georgia Louisiana and Texas followed Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the Confederate States of America The upper South and border states Delaware Maryland Virginia North Carolina Tennessee Kentucky Missouri and Arkansas listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal President Buchanan and President elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy declaring secession illegal The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February There were attempts at compromise The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of dividing the territories into slave and free contrary to the Republican Party s free soil platform Lincoln rejected the idea saying I will suffer death before I consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right Lincoln however did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent A few weeks before the war Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution En route to his inauguration by train Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North The president elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore who were uncovered by Lincoln s head of security Allan Pinkerton On February he arrived in disguise in Washington D C which was placed under substantial military guard Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South proclaiming once again that he had no intention or inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South We are not enemies but friends We must not be enemies The mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature The failure of the Peace Conference of signaled that legislative compromise was impossible By March no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms Meanwhile Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated Lincoln said as the war was ending The commander of Fort Sumter South Carolina Major Robert Anderson sent a request for provisions to Washington and the execution of Lincoln s order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war On April Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter forcing them to surrender and began the war Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the South was preparing for war Donald concludes that His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood But he also vowed not to surrender the forts The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that On April Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling troops to recapture forts protect Washington and preserve the Union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states This call forced the states to choose sides Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital despite the exposed position of Richmond so close to Union lines North Carolina Tennessee and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland but did not prevail Kentucky tried to be neutral Troops headed south towards Washington to protect the capital in response to Lincoln s call On April secessionist mobs in Baltimore that controlled the rail links attacked Union troops traveling to the capital George William Brown the Mayor of Baltimore and other suspected Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned without a warrant as Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus John Merryman a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland petitioned Chief Justice Roger B Taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful Taney issued the writ thereby ordering Merryman s release but Lincoln ignored it Then and throughout the war Lincoln came under heavy attack from antiwar Democrats called Copperheads After the Battle of Fort Sumter Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander in chief using unprecedented powers He expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress and after suspending habeas corpus arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions In addition Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln and dominated his time and attention From the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue Conversely the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery On August Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort In practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy In late August General John C Fremont the Republican presidential nominee issued without consulting his superiors in Washington a proclamation of martial law in Missouri He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court martialed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed Fremont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption Lincoln overruled Fremont s proclamation Lincoln believed that Fremont s emancipation was political neither militarily necessary nor legal After Lincoln acted Union enlistments from Maryland Kentucky and Missouri increased by over troops The Trent Affair of late threatened war with Great Britain The U S Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship the Trent on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys Britain protested vehemently while the U S cheered Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain Lincoln s foreign policy approach had been initially hands off due to his inexperience he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State William Seward Seward s initial reaction to the Trent affair however was too bellicose so Lincoln also turned to Senator Charles Sumner the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy To learn technical military terms Lincoln borrowed and studied Henry Halleck s book Elements of Military Art and Science from the Library of Congress Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the War Department in Washington D C He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort consulted with governors and selected generals based on their past success as well as their state and party In January after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton as War Secretary Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction Nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together say Thomas and Hyman In terms of war strategy Lincoln articulated two priorities to ensure that Washington was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt decisive victory major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within days Twice a week Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General Henry Halleck a student of the European strategist Jomini of the critical need to control strategic points such as the Mississippi River he also knew well the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy s army rather than simply capturing territory After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late Lincoln appointed Major General George B McClellan general in chief of all the Union armies McClellan a young West Point graduate railroad executive and Pennsylvania Democrat took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign longer than Lincoln wanted The campaign s objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital McClellan s repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan s troops in defense of the capital McClellan who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign Lincoln removed McClellan as general in chief and appointed Henry Wager Halleck in March after McClellan s Harrison s Landing Letter in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort McClellan s letter incensed Radical Republicans who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope a Republican as head of the new Army of Virginia Pope complied with Lincoln s strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack However lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan now commanding the Army of the Potomac Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time The war also expanded with naval operations in when the CSS Virginia formerly the USS Merrimack damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk Virginia before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan s failure to reinforce Pope Lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around Washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward Two days after McClellan s return to command General Robert E Lee s forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland leading to the Battle of Antietam in September The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation McClellan then resisted the President s demand that he pursue Lee s retreating and exposed army while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee As a result Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans and after the midterm elections he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander in Chief Burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined Desertions during were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship The mid term elections in brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of habeas corpus the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest While Republicans were discouraged Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania Ohio Indiana and New York The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states except New York The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress In the spring of Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together these plans included Hooker s attack on Lee north of Richmond Rosecrans on Chattanooga Grant s on Vicksburg and a naval assault on Charleston Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May but continued to command his troops for some weeks He ignored Lincoln s order to divide his troops and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper s Ferry and tendered his resignation which Lincoln accepted He was replaced by George Meade who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign which was a victory for the Union though Lee s army avoided capture At the same time after initial setbacks Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor After the Battle of Gettysburg Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general in chief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans Even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander in Chief Lincoln understood that the Federal government s power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution which before committed the issue to individual states He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U S territory At the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the Founding Fathers under the constitution President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C Fremont in August and by Major General David Hunter in May on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union On June endorsed by Lincoln Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory In July the Second Confiscation Act was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress s power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander in Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution and Lincoln was planning to take that action In that month Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet In it he stated that as a fit and necessary military measure on January all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free Privately Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August The President said the primary goal of his actions as president he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his official duty was preserving the Union The Emancipation Proclamation issued on September and put into effect on January declared free the slaves in states not then under Union control with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states Lincoln spent the next days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while Democrats rallied their voters in the off year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective as Union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed Lincoln s comment on the signing of the Proclamation was I never in my life felt more certain that I was doing right than I do in signing this paper For some time Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed A few days after Emancipation was announced Republican governors met at the War Governors Conference they supported the president s Proclamation but suggested the removal of General George B McClellan as commander of the Union Army Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation By the spring of Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers In a letter to Andrew Johnson the military governor of Tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops Lincoln wrote The bare sight of armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once By the end of at Lincoln s direction General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln In his company I was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort despite the New York City draft riots The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November Defying Lincoln s prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the Address became the most quoted speech in American history In words and three minutes Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in but in conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective a new birth of freedom in the nation Meade s failure to capture Lee s army as it retreated from Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed General Ulysses S Grant s victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh Lincoln had said I can t spare this man He fights With Grant in command Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops Nevertheless Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in as McClellan was Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant s political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the Senate Grant s promotion to commander of the Union Army He obtained Congress s consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General which no officer had held since George Washington Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in This is often characterized as a war of attrition given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the Confederate forces had almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North Grant had lost a third of his army and Lincoln asked what Grant s plans were to which the general replied I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer The Confederacy lacked reinforcements so Lee s army shrank with every costly battle Grant s army moved south crossed the James River forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg Virginia Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant s headquarters at City Point Virginia This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North and replaced the Union losses Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure such as plantations railroads and bridges hoping to destroy the South s morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting Grant s move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia s Shenandoah Valley The damage caused by Sherman s March to the Sea through Georgia in was limited to a swath but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the Confederate armies As Neely concludes there was no effort to engage in total war against civilians as in World War II Confederate general Jubal Anderson Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital During Early s raid on Washington D C in Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him Get down you damn fool before you get shot After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched As Grant continued to wear down Lee s forces efforts to discuss peace began Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln Seward and others at Hampton Roads Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results On April Grant successfully outflanked Lee s forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond Days later when that city fell Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital as he walked through the city white Southerners were stone faced but freedmen greeted him as a hero On April Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over While the war was still being waged Lincoln faced reelection in Lincoln was a master politician bringing together and holding together all the main factions of the Republican Party and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers greatly expanded over peacetime to hold the factions of his party together build support for his own policies and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the ticket At its convention the Republican Party selected Johnson a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee as his running mate To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party When Grant s spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the President s re election prospects and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated Sharing this fear Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate General George B McClellan supported the war and repudiated the platform Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort Sherman s capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut s capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters the Democratic Party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln By contrast the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads Lincoln was re elected in a landslide carrying all but three states and receiving percent of the Union soldiers vote On March Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address In it he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God s will Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world Lincoln said Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves Shortly after Lee s surrender a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated and Lincoln replied Let em up easy In keeping with that sentiment Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radical Republicans under Rep Thaddeus Stevens Sen Charles Sumner and Sen Benjamin Wade political allies of the president on other issues Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war His Amnesty Proclamation of December offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office had not mistreated Union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance As Southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re formed Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors respectively In Louisiana Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when percent of the voters agreed to it Lincoln s Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans political aspirations On the other hand the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the Wade Davis Bill in When Lincoln vetoed the bill the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana Arkansas and Tennessee Lincoln s appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness To fill Chief Justice Taney s seat on the Supreme Court he named the choice of the Radicals Salmon P Chase who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation which did not apply to every state Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment Lincoln declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter By December a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two thirds majority on June in the House of Representatives Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican Unionist platform in the election of After a long debate in the House a second attempt passed Congress on January and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification Upon ratification it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December As the war drew to a close Lincoln s presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner s Freedmen s Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction Shortly before his assassination Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern Unionists Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen Lincoln biographers James G Randall and Richard Current according to David Lincove argue that Eric Foner argues that The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country The term the United States has historically been used sometimes in the plural these United States and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the th century In recent years historians such as Harry Jaffa Herman Belz John Diggins Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln s redefinition of republican values As early as the s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values what he called the sheet anchor of republicanism The Declaration s emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the Constitution s tolerance of slavery shifted the debate As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms Nevertheless in Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the Constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state Burton argues that Lincoln s republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated In March in Lincoln s first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy He denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system He said A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress the only important one was the Wade Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction He signed the Homestead Act in making millions of acres of government held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost The Morrill Land Grant Colleges Act also signed in provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state The Pacific Railway Acts of and granted federal support for the construction of the United States First Transcontinental Railroad which was completed in The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the s Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government tariffs a policy with long precedent and a new Federal income tax In Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff the first having become law under James Buchanan Also in Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of creating the first U S income tax This created a flat tax of percent on incomes above in current dollar terms which was later changed by the Revenue Act of to a progressive rate structure Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government s economic influence in several other areas The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country It also established a national currency In Congress created with Lincoln s approval the Department of Agriculture In Lincoln sent a senior general John Pope to put down the Sioux Uprising in Minnesota Presented with execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving for execution one was later reprieved President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy In the wake of Grant s casualties in his campaign against Lee Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft but it was never issued In response to rumors of one however the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market Lincoln s reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior he ordered the military to seize the two papers The seizure lasted for two days Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States Before Lincoln s presidency Thanksgiving while a regional holiday in New England since the th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates The last such proclamation had been during James Madison s presidency years before In Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving In June Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park Lincoln s declared philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court Noah Haynes Swayne nominated January and appointed January was chosen as an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union Samuel Freeman Miller nominated and appointed on July supported Lincoln in the election and was an avowed abolitionist David Davis Lincoln s campaign manager in nominated December and appointed December had also served as a judge in Lincoln s Illinois court circuit Stephen Johnson Field a previous California Supreme Court justice was nominated March and appointed March and provided geographic balance as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat Finally Lincoln s Treasury Secretary Salmon P Chase was nominated as Chief Justice and appointed the same day on December Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist would support Reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the Republican Party Lincoln appointed federal judges including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States and judges to the United States district courts Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office West Virginia admitted to the Union June contained the former north westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union As a condition for its admission West Virginia s constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery Nevada which became the third State in the far west of the continent was admitted as a free state on October John Wilkes Booth was a well known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland though he never joined the Confederate army he had contacts with the Confederate secret service In Booth formulated a plan very similar to one of Thomas N Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners After attending an April speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president Learning that the President First Lady and head Union general Ulysses S Grant would be attending Ford s Theatre Booth formulated a plan with co conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson Secretary of State William H Seward and General Grant Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April Grant along with his wife chose at the last minute to travel to Philadelphia instead of attending the play Lincoln s bodyguard John Parker left Ford s Theater during intermission to join Lincoln s coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony Seizing the opportunity Booth crept up from behind and at about pm aimed at the back of Lincoln s head and fired at point blank range mortally wounding the President Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but Booth stabbed him and escaped After being on the run for days Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia some south of Washington D C After refusing to surrender to Union troops Booth was killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett on April An Army surgeon Doctor Charles Leale was sitting nearby at the theater and immediately assisted the President He found the President unresponsive barely breathing and with no detectable pulse Having determined that the President had been shot in the head and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought he made an attempt to clear the blood clot after which the President began to breathe more naturally The dying President was taken across the street to Petersen House After remaining in a coma for nine hours Lincoln died at am on April Presbyterian minister Phineas Densmore Gurley then present was asked to offer a prayer after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said Now he belongs to the ages Lincoln s flag enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers while the city s church bells rang President Johnson was sworn in at am less than hours after Lincoln s death The late President lay in state in the East Room and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April through April For his final journey with his son Willie both caskets were transported in the executive coach United States and for three weeks the Lincoln Special funeral train decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln s remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D C to Springfield Illinois stopping at many cities across the North for large scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands bonfires and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by As a young man Lincoln was a religious skeptic or in the words of a biographer even an iconoclast Later in life Lincoln s frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences who were mostly evangelical Protestants He never joined a church although he frequently attended with his wife but he was deeply familiar with the Bible quoted it and praised it He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs However he did believe in an all powerful God that shaped events and by was expressing those beliefs in major speeches In the s Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power In the s Lincoln acknowledged providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence When he suffered the death of his son Edward Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God The death of his son Willie in February may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace After Willie s death Lincoln considered why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary He wrote at this time that God could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest Yet the contest began And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day Yet the contest proceeds On the day Lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land Several claims abound that Lincoln s health was declining before the assassination These are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder MEN b which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma mucosal neuromas and a Marfinoid appearance Others simply claim he had Marfan s syndrome based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers and the association of possible aortic regurgitation which can cause bobbing of the head DeMusset s sign based on blurring of Lincoln s head in photographs which back then had a long exposure time DNA analysis is so far being refused by the Grand Army of the Republic museum in Philadelphia In surveys of scholars ranking Presidents since the s Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three often A study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after Washington Of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls Schlesinger Schlesinger Murray Blessing Survey Chicago Tribune poll Schlesinger CSPAN Ridings McIver Time and CSPAN Generally the top three presidents are rated as Lincoln George Washington and Franklin D Roosevelt although Lincoln and Washington and Washington and Roosevelt occasionally are reversed President Lincoln s assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty Republicans linked Lincoln s name to their party Many though not all in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability Schwartz argues that Lincoln s reputation grew slowly in the late th century until the Progressive Era s when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history with even white Southerners in agreement The high point came in with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state In the Cold War years Lincoln s image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes By the s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers As a Whig activist Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks internal improvements and railroads in opposition to the agrarian Democrats William C Harris found that Lincoln s reverence for the Founding Fathers the Constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism James G Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform Randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the South hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders By the late s liberals such as historian Lerone Bennett were having second thoughts especially regarding Lincoln s views on racial issues Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs told jokes that ridiculed blacks insisted he opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country Defenders such as authors Dirck and Cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in that Lincoln s image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late th century On the other hand Donald opined in his biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood almost always in a flattering light Lincoln s portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency the penny and the bill His likeness also appears on many postage stamps and has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of Nebraska The most famous and most visited memorials are the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D C Lincoln s sculpture on Mount Rushmore Ford s Theatre and Petersen House where he died in Washington and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum located in Springfield Illinois not far from Lincoln s home and his tomb Barry Schwartz a sociologist who has examined America s cultural memory argues that in the s and s the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life During the Great Depression he argues Lincoln served as a means for seeing the world s disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful Franklin D Roosevelt preparing America for war used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan Americans asked What would Lincoln do However he also finds that since World War II Lincoln s symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept 
Aristotle Aristotle Aristoteles was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in Stagirus northern Greece in His father Nicomachus died when Aristotle was a child whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian At eighteen he joined Plato s Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven c His writings cover many subjectsincluding physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theater music rhetoric linguistics politics and governmentand constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy Shortly after Plato died Aristotle left Athens and at the request of Philip of Macedon tutored Alexander the Great between and According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica Aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history Every scientist is in his debt Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism but following Plato s death Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism He believed all peoples concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception Aristotle s views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works Aristotle s views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship Their influence extended into the Renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics Some of Aristotle s zoological observations were not confirmed or refuted until the th century His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic which was incorporated in the late th century into modern formal logic In metaphysics Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology especially the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as The First Teacher His ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics All aspects of Aristotle s philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialoguesCicero described his literary style as a river of gold it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived Aristotle whose name means the best purpose was born in in Stagira Chalcidice about km miles east of modern day Thessaloniki His father Nicomachus was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon Although there is little information on Aristotle s childhood he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy At about the age of eighteen Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Plato s Academy He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy s direction after control passed to Plato s nephew Speusippus although it is possible that he feared anti Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died Aristotle and Plato s compatibility has been a strongly debated topic Recently Harold Cherniss summarized Aristotle s Platonism from the standpoint of classicist Werner Jaeger stating that Jaeger in whose eyes Plato s philosophy was the matter out of which the newer and higher form of Aristotle s thought proceeded by a gradual but steady and undeviating development Aristotles pronounced the old controversy whether or not Aristotle understood Plato to be absolut verstandnislos Yet this did not prevent Leisegang from reasserting that Aristotle s own pattern of thinking was incompatible with a proper understanding of Plato Contrary to Leisegang s sympathies Jaeger was sympathetic to a compatible reading of Aristotle and Plato Aristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor There he traveled with Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island Aristotle married Pythias either Hermias s adoptive daughter or niece She bore him a daughter whom they also named Pythias Soon after Hermias death Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander in Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander but also to two other future kings Ptolemy and Cassander Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric In one famous example he counsels Alexander to be a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants By Artistotle had returned to Athens establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years While in Athens his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of Stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father Nicomachus According to the Suda he also had an eromenos Palaephatus of Abydus This period in Athens between and is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works He wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived Those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students His most important treatises include Physics Metaphysics Nicomachean Ethics Politics De Anima On the Soul and Poetics Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time but made significant contributions to most of them In physical science Aristotle studied anatomy astronomy embryology geography geology meteorology physics and zoology In philosophy he wrote on aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics economics psychology rhetoric and theology He also studied education foreign customs literature and poetry His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge Near the end of his life Alexander became paranoid and wrote threatening letters to Aristotle Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexander s pretense of divinity and the king had executed Aristotle s grandnephew Callisthenes as a traitor A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander s death but there is little evidence Following Alexander s death anti Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled In Eurymedon the Hierophant denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor prompting him to flee to his mother s family estate in Chalcis explaining I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy a reference to Athens s prior trial and execution of Socrates He died in Euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student Antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife In general the details of the life of Aristotle are not well established The biographies of Aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points With the Prior Analytics Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until th century advances in mathematical logic Kant stated in the Critique of Pure Reason that Aristotle s theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference Aristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of However Plato reports that syntax was devised before him by Prodicus of Ceos who was concerned by the correct use of words Logic seems to have emerged from dialectics the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions but never truly understood the logical implications Even Plato had difficulties with logic although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system he could never actually construct one thus he relied instead on his dialectic Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow Consequently Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial He never succeeded in devising such a method but his best attempt was published in his book Sophist where he introduced his division method What we today call Aristotelian logic Aristotle himself would have labeled analytics The term logic he reserved to mean dialectics Most of Aristotle s work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early st century CE The order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle s writings It goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the Categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in On Interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the Analytics and dialectics in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning There is one volume of Aristotle s concerning logic not found in the Organon namely the fourth book of Metaphysics Like his teacher Plato Aristotle s philosophy aims at the universal Aristotle s ontology however finds the universal in particular things which he calls the essence of things while in Plato s ontology the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar For Aristotle therefore epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these For Aristotle form still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is instantiated in a particular substance see Universals and particulars below In a certain sense Aristotle s method is both inductive and deductive while Plato s is essentially deductive from a priori principles In Aristotle s terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences In modern times the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics in which logic plays a major role Today s philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method In contrast Aristotle s philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry In the larger sense of the word Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science Note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method For Aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical Metaphysics b By practical science he means ethics and politics by poetical science he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts by theoretical science he means physics mathematics and metaphysics If logic or analytics is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of Logic Theoretical Philosophy including Metaphysics Physics and Mathematics Practical Philosophy and Poetical Philosophy In the period between his two stays in Athens between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today In fact most of Aristotle s life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science Aristotle s metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics He did however perform original research in the natural sciences e g botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology and several other sciences Aristotle s writings on science are largely qualitative as opposed to quantitative Beginning in the th century scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences and Aristotle s work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass velocity force and temperature He had a conception of speed and temperature but no quantitative understanding of them which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices like clocks and thermometers His writings provide an account of many scientific observations a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors For example in his History of Animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females In a similar vein John Philoponus and later Galileo showed by simple experiments that Aristotle s theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect On the other hand Aristotle refuted Democritus s claim that the Milky Way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun s rays pointing out correctly even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time that given current astronomical demonstrations that the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them In places Aristotle goes too far in deriving laws of the universe from simple observation and over stretched reason Today s scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective and that discerning the validity of one s hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the Metaphysics which was widely accepted up until the th century From the rd century to the th century the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational center of the universe Because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance these thinkers often took Aristotle s erroneous positions as given which held back science in this epoch However Aristotle s scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields For instance he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia Moreover he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants As quoted from Charles Lyell s Principles of Geology He Aristotle refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer to the shallowing of the Palus Maeotis within sixty years from his own time He alludes to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption The changes of the earth he says are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives that they are overlooked and the migrations of people after great catastrophes and their removal to other regions cause the event to be forgotten He says th chapter of his Meteorics the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land and again it becomes land where it was sea and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system and within a certain period The concluding observation is as follows As time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the Tanais nor the Nile can have flowed for ever The places where they rise were once dry and there is a limit to their operations but there is none to time So also of all other rivers they spring up and they perish and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts therefore of the earth are not some always sea and others always continents but every thing changes in the course of time Aristotle proposed a fifth element aether in addition to the four proposed earlier by Empedocles Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe i e the center of the Earth Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere Fire tends toward the lunar sphere in which the Moon orbits When elements are moved out of their natural place they naturally move back towards it This is natural motion motion requiring no extrinsic cause So for example in water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up in air rain falls and flame rises Outside all the other spheres the heavenly fifth element manifested in the stars and planets moves in the perfection of circles Aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality as such Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential as a transition toward a potentially possible state Because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in Aristotle other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous or that the addition of the as such to the definition is critical to understanding it Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors Additionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect Moreover Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absence may result in different outcomes Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino because it cannot fall of its own accord Aristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation All causes proper and incidental can be spoken as potential or as actual particular or generic The same language refers to the effects of causes so that generic effects assigned to generic causes particular effects to particular causes operating causes to actual effects Essentially causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day The second oldest written evidence of a camera obscura after Mozi c BC can be found in Aristotle s documentation of such a device in BC in Problemata Aristotle s apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole or aperture to allow for sunlight to enter Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object In modern cameras this is analogous to the diaphragm Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased the image was magnified According to Aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things It is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance For a better understanding of Aristotle s conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place For example A person seeks donations That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum However if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance It must be unusual that something happens by chance In other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance There is also more specific kind of chance which Aristotle names luck that can only apply to human beings because it is in the sphere of moral actions According to Aristotle luck must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance Aristotle defines metaphysics as the knowledge of immaterial being or of being in the highest degree of abstraction He refers to metaphysics as first philosophy as well as the theologic science Aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence ousia in his Metaphysics Book VII and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form In book VIII he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed For example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia see also predicables that let us define something as a house The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form With regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his Physics and On Generation and Corruption b a he distinguishes the coming to be from The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form Referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else For example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become a plant Potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned For example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality Because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end Referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do For that for the sake of which a thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired For animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see In summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality With this definition of the particular substance i e matter and form Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one Since according to Plato there are two Ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity However according to Aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same thing Aristotle s predecessor Plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things When we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyze a form of an apple In this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple Moreover we can place an apple next to a book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things For example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form Bertrand Russell is a th century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of uninstantiated universals Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things According to Aristotle if a universal exists either as a particular or a relation then there must have been must be currently or must be in the future something on which the universal can be predicated Consequently according to Aristotle if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time then it does not exist In addition Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals As Plato spoke of the world of the forms a location where all universal forms subsist Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated So according to Aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms In Aristotelian science especially in biology things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others which contain error and superstition He dissected animals but not humans his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of Lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas The works that reflect this research such as History of Animals Generation of Animals and Parts of Animals contain some observations and interpretations along with sundry myths and mistakes The most striking passages are about the sea life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen His observations on catfish electric fish Torpedo and angler fish are detailed as is his writing on cephalopods namely Octopus Sepia cuttlefish and the paper nautilus Argonauta argo His description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the th century He separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selache selachians Another good example of his methods comes from the Generation of Animals in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated He gave accurate descriptions of ruminants four chambered fore stomachs and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark Mustelus mustelus Aristotle s classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the th century What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates Aristotle called animals with blood and animals without blood he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of hemoglobin but of a different kind from vertebrates Animals with blood were divided into live bearing humans and mammals and egg bearing birds and fish Invertebrates animals without blood are insects crustacea divided into non shelled cephalopods and shelled and testacea molluscs In some respects this incomplete classification is better than that of Linnaeus who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups Insecta and Vermes worms For Charles Singer Nothing is more remarkable than Aristotle s efforts to exhibit the relationships of living things as a scala naturae Aristotle s History of Animals classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical Ladder of Life scala naturae or Great Chain of Being placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes i e final causes guided all natural processes Such a teleological view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design Noting that no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns and a single hooved animal with two horns I have never seen Aristotle suggested that Nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance In a similar fashion Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man the scala naturae His system had eleven grades arranged according to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality expressed in their form at birth The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs Aristotle also held that the level of a creature s perfection was reflected in its form but not preordained by that form Ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times He placed emphasis on the types of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans a vegetative a sensitive and a rational soul capable of thought and reflection Aristotle in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the Egyptians placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain Notable is Aristotle s division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of Alcmaeon Aristotle s successor at the Lyceum Theophrastus wrote a series of books on botany the History of Plants which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany even into the Middle Ages Many of Theophrastus names survive into modern times such as carpos for fruit and pericarpion for seed vessel Rather than focus on formal causes as Aristotle did Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes and relying on Aristotle s concept of the efficient cause Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants though this last discovery was lost in later ages After Theophrastus the Lyceum failed to produce any original work Though interest in Aristotle s ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found The first medical teacher at Alexandria Herophilus of Chalcedon corrected Aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of Christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the th and th centuries Ernst Mayr claimed that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance Aristotle s ideas of natural history and medicine survived but they were generally taken unquestioningly Aristotle s psychology given in his treatise On the Soul peri psyche often known by its Latin title De Anima posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul Humans have a rational soul This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally The unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them For Aristotle the soul psyche was a simpler concept than it is for us today By soul he simply meant the form of a living being Because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings e g the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which Aristotle considers types of movement According to Aristotle memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past In other words a memory is a mental picture phantasm in which Aristotle defines in De Anima as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory Aristotle believed an imprint becomes impressed on a semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory A memory occurs when a stimuli is too complex that the nervous system semi fluid bodily organ cannot receive all the impressions at once These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation common sense and thinking The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard every experience ends up as a mental image in memory Aristotle uses the word memory for two basic abilities First the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic imprint that can develop from sensation Second the intellectual anxiety that comes with the imprint due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time Therefore memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present The retrieval of our imprints cannot be performed suddenly A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience Aristotle proposed that slow witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the imprint can easily continue However they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new imprints He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an imprint Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop while the elderly s organs are beginning to decay thus stunting new imprints Likewise people who are too quick witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory memories belong to some animals too but only those in which have perception of time Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or imprints people are continually weaving together new imprints of things they experience In order to search for these imprints people search the memory itself Within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for Recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another If the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the other If the chain of images is not needed but expected then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances When people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed Recollection is the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory imprint after some time has passed Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being human or animal and the abilities the human or animal possesses Only humans will remember imprints of intellectual activity such as numbers and words Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed Recollection of an imprint is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences When an imprint is recalled it may bring forth a large group of related imprints Aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain imprints was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships similarity contrast and contiguity These three laws make up his Laws of Association Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience According to Aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study i e one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake He wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuche normally translated as soul in accordance with reason logos Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ethike arete often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher In addition to his works on ethics which address the individual Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled Politics Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community Moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part He also famously stated that man is by nature a political animal Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others Aristotle s conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle s understanding Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to Aristotle was the city polis which functions as a political community or partnership koinonia The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts The political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together This is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences Aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative each varying in imitation by medium object and manner For example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language The forms also differ in their object of imitation Comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average Lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind s advantages over animals While it is believed that Aristotle s Poetics comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle and studied the fables of Aesop Aristotle s analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element On this ground feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism However Aristotle gave equal weight to women s happiness as he did to men s and commented in his Rhetoric that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too Modern scholarship reveals that Aristotle s lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication the surviving works do not appear to have been so Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect with some books duplicating or summarizing each other the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotle s at all Some of the individual works within the corpus including the Constitution of Athens are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle s school perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision Others such as On Colors may have been produced by Aristotle s successors at the Lyceum e g Theophrastus and Straton Still others acquired Aristotle s name through similarities in doctrine or content such as the De Plantis possibly by Nicolaus of Damascus Other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self promotional According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric and the esoteric Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public exoteric and the more technical works intended for use within the school esoteric Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle s own unpolished lecture notes or in some cases possible notes by his students However one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation The th century neoplatonist Ammonius Hermiae writes that Aristotle s writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant that all of Aristotle s extant writings are of the esoteric kind Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious though many of them may have been in dialogue form Fragments of some of Aristotle s dialogues have survived Perhaps it is to these that Cicero refers when he characterized Aristotle s writing style as a river of gold it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us However some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero s praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle s extant works One major question in the history of Aristotle s works then is how were the exoteric writings all lost and how did the ones we now possess come to us The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by Strabo in his Geography and Plutarch in his Parallel Lives The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus who in turn willed them to Neleus of Scepsis Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to Scepsis where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the st century BC when Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts bringing them back to Athens According to the story Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts stay in the basement introducing a number of errors into the text When Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in BC he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome where they were first published in BC by the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus and then by the philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B C Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story however First the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon s inexpert attempt at repair Second there is incontrovertible evidence Lord says that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis Third the definitive edition of Aristotle s texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his And fourth ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess Lord sees a number of post Aristotelian interpolations in the Politics for example but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact On the one hand the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle s school as opposed on the other hand to the dialogues and other exoteric texts which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle s school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today More than years after his death Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields According to the philosopher Bryan Magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did Among countless other achievements Aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method Despite these achievements the influence of Aristotle s errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably Bertrand Russell notes that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine Russell also refers to Aristotle s ethics as repulsive and calls his logic as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors The immediate influence of Aristotle s work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school Aristotle s notable students included Aristoxenus Dicaearchus Demetrius of Phalerum Eudemos of Rhodes Harpalus Hephaestion Meno Mnason of Phocis Nicomachus and Theophrastus Aristotle s influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle s geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public Alexander complained Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men s common property Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were John Philoponus Elias and David in the sixth century and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century John Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle s views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of Aristotelian thought After a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by Eustratius and Michael of Ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by Anna Comnena Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early Islamic theology Most of the still extant works of Aristotle as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers scientists and scholars Averroes Avicenna and Alpharabius who wrote on Aristotle in great depth also influenced Thomas Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers Alkindus considered Aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the First Teacher The title teacher was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars and was later used by Western philosophers as in the famous poem of Dante who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy In accordance with the Greek theorists the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher the author of a closed system and believed that Aristotle shared with Plato essential tenets of thought Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo Platonic metaphysical ideas With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West Aristotle was practically unknown there from c CE to c except through the Latin translation of the Organon made by Boethius In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made both from Arabic translations such as those by Gerard of Cremona and from the original Greek such as those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke After Thomas Aquinas wrote his theology working from Moerbeke s translations the demand for Aristotle s writings grew and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance Aristotle is referred to as The Philosopher by Scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas See Summa Theologica Part I Question etc These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods The medieval English poet Chaucer describes his student as being happy by having The Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in the first circles of hell The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle However implausible this is it is certainly the case that Aristotle s rigid separation of action from production and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue or arete of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy It is Martin Heidegger not Nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition Ayn Rand accredited Aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as a major influence on her thinking More recently Alasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum These texts as opposed to Aristotle s lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle s school Reference to them is made according to the organization of Immanuel Bekker s Royal Prussian Academy edition Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica Berlin which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works The Aristotle Mountains along the Oscar II Coast of Graham Land Antarctica are named after Aristotle He was the first person known to conjecture the existence of a landmass in the southern high latitude region and call it Antarctica The secondary literature on Aristotle is vast The following references are only a small selection Collections of works
An American in Paris An American in Paris is a symphonic poem by the American composer George Gershwin written in Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in Paris it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the s and is one of his best known compositions Gershwin composed An American in Paris on commission from the conductor Walter Damrosch He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition which took place on December in Carnegie Hall with Damrosch conducting the New York Philharmonic Gershwin completed the orchestration on November less than four weeks before the work s premiere Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer Deems Taylor noting that My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere When the tone poem moves into the blues our American friend has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness But nostalgia is not a fatal disease The American visitor once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life and the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant Maurice Ravel met Gershwin in New York during Ravel s tour of the United States In that meeting Gershwin asked Ravel to be his teacher to which Ravel responded that it was better to be a first rate Gershwin than a second rate Ravel Instead Ravel recommended that Gershwin see Nadia Boulanger in Paris Ravel s high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in Paris Gershwin arrived in Paris in March Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them Ezra Pound W B Yeats Ernest Hemingway and artist Pablo Picasso Gershwin met with Boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music Boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him This did not set Gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his Rhapsody in Blue Gershwin based An American in Paris on a melodic fragment called Very Parisienne written in on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts Robert and Mabel Schirmer He described the piece as a rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works Gershwin explained in Musical America My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere The piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose ABA format Gershwin s first A episode introduces the two main walking themes in the Allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the Subito con brio The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers Claude Debussy and Les Six This A section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe English horn and taxi horns The B section s Andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the American Blues and spasms of homesickness The Allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve bar blues In the B section Gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum Moderato con grazia is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A After recapitulating the walking themes Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final Grandioso An American in Paris is scored for flutes rd doubling on piccolo oboes English horn clarinets in B flat bass clarinet in B flat bassoons horns in F trumpets in B flat trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block cymbals low and high tom toms xylophone glockenspiel celesta taxi horns labeled as A B C and D alto saxophone soprano saxophone tenor saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone baritone saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone and strings The revised edition by F Campbell Watson calls for three saxophones alto tenor and baritone In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments William Daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch s interpretation at the world premiere of An American in Paris He stated that Damrosch s sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work The audience according to Edward Cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses Critics believed that An American in Paris was better crafted than his lukewarm Concerto in F Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers Cesar Franck Richard Wagner or Guillaume Lekeu on its premiere Gershwin responded to the critics It s not a Beethoven Symphony you know It s a humorous piece nothing solemn about it It s not intended to draw tears If it pleases symphony audiences as a light jolly piece a series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds On September it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released The Gershwin family working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin s true intent It is unknown if the critical score will include the material Gershwin later deleted from the work or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin s composition process The score to An American in Paris is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released The project may take to years to complete The first edition will probably be published by An American in Paris has been frequently recorded The first recording was made for RCA Victor in with Nathaniel Shilkret conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra drawn from members of the Philadelphia Orchestra Gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio Then a little later Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording The radio broadcast of the September Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert in which An American in Paris also conducted by Shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in in a two CD set Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the work for RCA Victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music In Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded the music in Carnegie Hall one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in the s of Gershwin s original score before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today In MGM released the musical An American in Paris featuring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron Winning the Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards the film was directed by Vincente Minnelli featured many tunes of Gershwin and concluded with an extensive elaborate dance sequence built around the An American in Paris symphonic poem arranged for the film by Johnny Green costing A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in As Good as It Gets released in

Academy Awards The Academy Awards commonly known as The Oscars is an annual American awards ceremony honoring cinematic achievements in the film industry Winners are awarded the statuette officially the Academy Award of Merit that is much better known by its nickname Oscar The awards first presented in at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel are overseen by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS The Oscar Academy Awards are an electoral race to the trophy to best film in any category The awards ceremony was first televised in and is now seen live in more than countries The Oscars is also the oldest entertainment awards ceremony its equivalents the Emmy Awards for television the Tony Awards for theatre and the Grammy Awards for music and recording are modeled after the Academy Awards The th Academy Awards ceremony was held on March at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles The first Academy Awards were presented on May at a private dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about people The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel The cost of guest tickets for that night s ceremony was as of Fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other personalities of the film making industry of the time for their works during the period the ceremony ran for minutes Winners had been announced to media three months earlier however that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in Since then and during the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at pm on the night of the awards This method was used until the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the Academy has since used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh He had to return to Europe before the ceremony so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first Academy Award winner in history The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period for example Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films Since the fourth ceremony the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film For the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years At the th ceremony held on March the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced Until then foreign language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award a total of Oscars have been given for awards Although there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy the Irving G Thalberg Memorial Award the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award the Gordon E Sawyer Award the Academy Scientific and Technical Award the Academy Award for Technical Achievement the John A Bonner Medal of Commendation and the Student Academy Award plus two awards that are not presented annually the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette the best known one is the Academy Award of Merit more popularly known as the Oscar statuette Made of gold plated britannium on a black metal base it is in cm tall weighs lb kg and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusader s sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy Actors Writers Directors Producers and Technicians In MGM s art director Cedric Gibbons one of the original Academy members supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on a scroll In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his future wife Dolores del Rio to Mexican film director and actor Emilio El Indio Fernandez Reluctant at first Fernandez was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the Oscar Then sculptor George Stanley who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl sculpted Gibbons s design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in percent tin and percent copper and then gold plated it The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base The original Oscar mold was cast in at the C W Shumway Sons Foundry in Batavia Illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes Since approximately Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R S Owens Company The awards weigh each and take between three to four weeks to manufacture each statue In support of the American effort in World War II the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended The origin of the name Oscar is disputed One biography of Bette Davis claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson one of the earliest mentions in print of the term Oscar dates back to a Time magazine article about the th Academy Awards Walt Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as Another claimed origin is that the Academy s Executive Secretary Margaret Herrick first saw the award in and made reference to the statuette s reminding her of her Uncle Oscar a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick s naming and seized the name in his byline Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette Oscar The trophy was officially dubbed the Oscar in by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Since the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the Academy keeps the statuette Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six figure sums In December Orson Welles Oscar for Citizen Kane Best Original Screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy On December it sold in an online auction for US In Harold Russell needed money for his wife s medical expenses In a controversial decision he consigned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions and on August in New York City the Oscar sold to a private collector for Russell defended his action saying I don t know why anybody would be critical My wife s health is much more important than sentimental reasons The movie will be here even if Oscar isn t Harold Russell is the only Academy Award winning actor to ever sell an Oscar While the Oscar is owned by the recipient it is essentially not on the open market Michael Todd s grandson tried to sell Todd s Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy which keeps them in its treasury Since Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January Prior to that the results were announced in early February The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of Academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production Actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering members percent of the Academy s composition Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and its predecessor Price Waterhouse for the past annual awards ceremonies All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures New membership proposals are considered annually The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join The release also stated that it has just under voting members While the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then In the results of a study conducted by The Los Angeles Times was published which revealed the demographic breakdown of approximately of AMPAS voting membership Of the active voters confirmed were Caucasian were male and were found to be over the age of of voting members are former nominees and winners In May the Academy sent a letter advising its or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in According to Rules and of the official Academy Awards Rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of January to midnight at the end of December in Los Angeles County California to qualify except for the Best Foreign Language Film For example the Best Picture winner The Hurt Locker was actually first released in but did not qualify for the awards as it did not play its Oscar qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid thus qualifying for the awards Rule states that a film must be feature length defined as a minimum of minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a mm or mm film print or in frame s or frame s progressive scan digital cinema format with native resolution not less than x Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year The form includes the production credits for all related categories Then each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around active members For most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories i e only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc In all major categories voters use an instant runoff voting ballot with potential nominees rewarded in the single transferable vote tally for having strong supporters who rank them first There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories like Foreign Film Documentary and Animated Feature Film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches In the special case of Best Picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category Foreign films must include English subtitles and each country can submit only one film per year The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories including Best Picture Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders For example a producer of the Best Picture nominee The Hurt Locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as front runner The Hurt Locker eventually won The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees It is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during November or December of the previous year This is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States excluding Hawaii they aired live in Alaska starting in for the first time since Canada the United Kingdom and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world The ceremony was watched by more than million Americans Other awards ceremonies such as the Emmys Golden Globes and Grammys are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on tape delay in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America if the awards are even televised The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources The Awards show was first televised in on NBC which continued to broadcast the event until when the ABC Network took over televising the festivities through after which NBC resumed the broadcasts ABC once again took over broadcast duties in and it is under contract to do so through the year The first countries to broadcast the Academy Awards on television aside from the United States were Canada the United Kingdom and Mexico the latter two countries did not broadcast the live show and Mexico did not carry the live event until By seven other countries namely Brazil Cuba Venezuela West Germany Belgium the Netherlands and France were already broadcasting the Awards show although previously filmed into a condensed minute version called the International Edition of the Academy Awards The Awards show was broadcast for the first time via satellite in but only two South American countries Chile and Brazil purchased the rights to air the live event By that time the television rights to the Awards show were sold in countries A decade later the TV rights to the Oscars were already being sold to countries and by the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in countries Until the arrival of subscription television in Europe Africa and the Middle East which enabled the Oscars to be broadcast live through these territories there was already available a previously filmed or taped minute version of the Awards show which was aired on broadcast television in these territories However several Asian and Australasian countries such as Japan Hong Kong South Korea Singapore Malaysia Australia and New Zealand were already carrying the live broadcast of the Awards show since the late s AMPAS still produces a condensed minute version of the Academy Awards for those territories in which the rights to the live broadcast are expensive After more than years of being held in late March or early April the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the NCAA Men s Division I Basketball Championship which would cut into the Academy Awards audience The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period Some years the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of Passover and Easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public Advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most Emmys in history with wins and nominations After many years of being held on Mondays at pm Eastern p m Pacific in the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at pm Eastern pm Pacific The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays that Los Angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office On March the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington D C In an In Memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding months a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names In terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours The first Oscars in lasted minutes At the other end of the spectrum the ceremony lasted four hours and four minutes In the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past seconds This according to organizer Bill Mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion The Academy has contemplated about moving the ceremony even further back into January citing TV viewers fatigue with the film industry s long awards season However such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail Also a January ceremony would have to compete with National Football League playoff games Historically the Oscarcast has pulled in a bigger haul when box office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy More than million viewers tuned to the telecast for the th Academy Awards in the year of Titanic which generated close to US million at the North American box office pre Oscars The th Academy Awards ceremony in which pre telecast box office earnings of US million received Awards including Best Picture drew million viewers The most watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date however was the nd Academy Awards Best Picture Midnight Cowboy which drew a household rating on April By contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings The th Academy Awards which awarded low budgeted independent film Crash with a pre Oscar gross of US million generated an audience of million with a household rating of In the th Academy Awards telecast was watched by million viewers on average with an household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date in spite of celebrating years of the Academy Awards The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film No Country for Old Men In the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel From to the ceremony alternated between two venues the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles Grauman s Chinese Theater in Hollywood then hosted the awards from to followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from to The st Academy Awards in were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academy s headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood From to the awards were presented at Hollywood s Pantages Theatre With the advent of television the awards took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the NBC International Theatre and then at the NBC Century Theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles The Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica California in By the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center In the Kodak Theatre became the permanent home of the award ceremonies However due to Eastman Kodak s bankruptcy issues this theatre was renamed the Hollywood and Highland Center in the days preceding the February awards ceremony As of May the theatre was once again renamed to the Dolby Theatre after Dolby Laboratories acquired the naming rights In the first year of the awards the Best Director award was split into two separate categories Drama and Comedy At times the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories Drama and Comedy Musical From the s through the s the Art Direction now Production Design Cinematography and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two separate categories black and white films and color films Prior to the Production Design award was called Art Direction while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup Another award entitled the Academy Award for Best Original Musical is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued However due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year it has not been awarded since when Purple Rain won The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories To date the following proposed categories have been rejected The Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the Academy membership as a whole They are not always presented on a consistent annual basis Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the Oscar season This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality William Friedkin an Academy Award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself In addition some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars The first to do so was Dudley Nichols Best Writing in for The Informer Nichols boycotted the th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers Guild George C Scott became the second person to refuse his award Best Actor in for Patton at the rd Academy Awards ceremony Scott described it as a meat parade saying I don t want any part of it The third was Marlon Brando who refused his award Best Actor in for The Godfather citing the film industry s discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans At the th Academy Awards ceremony Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather to read a page speech detailing his criticisms Tim Dirks editor of AMC s filmsite org has written of the Academy Awards Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the U S the last three months of the calendar year This has led to the coining of the term Oscar bait describing such movies Overall the Academy appears to go through periods of rewarding a certain type of film war themed movies in the early s social issue dramas in the late s late s and mid s musicals and historical epics in the early to mid s family melodramas and biographical epics in the late s and throughout the s atypical genres movies formerly considered B movies in the early s and s romantic historical epic dramas in the late s and early s independent violent movies from critically acclaimed directors in the late s and th century historical movies in the s This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience e g by favoring Oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues The Academy appears to compensate by nominating these movies in other categories e g effects and editing awards for science fiction and action movies screenplay and supporting acting nominations for comedies and directing cinematography and foreign language nominations for critically acclaimed art films Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons personal popularity atonement for past mistakes or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominee s entire body of work The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards ceremony It has been a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars In later years these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners The total value of these gifts can reach into the s of thousands of dollars In the value was reported to be as high as US The value has risen to the point where the U S Internal Revenue Service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status The assortment of gifts varies significantly Oscar

International Atomic Time International Atomic Time TAI from the French name Temps atomique international is a high precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on Earth s geoid It is the basis for Coordinated Universal Time UTC which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth s surface and for Terrestrial Time which is used for astronomical calculations Since June when the last leap second was added TAI has been exactly seconds ahead of UTC The seconds results from the initial difference of seconds at the start of plus leap seconds in UTC since Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth Specifically both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used TAI in this form was synchronised with Universal Time at the beginning of and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the Earth TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks in over national laboratories worldwide The clocks are compared using GPS signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone see signal averaging for a discussion The majority of the clocks are caesium clocks the definition of the SI second is written in terms of caesium The participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of TAI Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC which differs from TAI by a well known integer number of seconds These time scales are denoted in the form UTCNPL in the UTC form where NPL in this case identifies the National Physical Laboratory UK The TAI form may be denoted TAINPL The latter is not to be confused with TANPL which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to TAI or to anything else The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other The International Bureau of Weights and Measures BIPM France combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible This combined time scale is published monthly in Circular T and is the canonical TAI This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC UTC k equivalent to TAI TAI k for each participating institution k The same circular also gives tables of TAI TA k for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T Aside from this once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale Doing so does not create another version of TAI it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of Terrestrial Time TT Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory UK NPL The Greenwich Atomic GA scale began in at the Royal Greenwich Observatory The International Time Bureau BIH began a time scale T or AM in July using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals The United States Naval Observatory began the A scale September using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the NBS A scale at the National Bureau of Standards Boulder Colorado Both the BIH scale and A was defined by an epoch at the beginning of it was set to read Julian Date January at the corresponding UT instant The procedures used by the BIH evolved and the name for the time scale changed A in and TABIH in This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of UT At the time UT as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second In UTC began UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated UT until the end of and UT thereafter This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale a linear transformation of the BIH s atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised while approximating UT means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in and in the name International Atomic Time TAI was assigned to a time scale based on SI seconds with no leap seconds During this time irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected In it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates but this was disproven in In the s it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks Starting from Julian Date January corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that TAI would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level this meant that TAI slowed down by about The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name EAL Echelle Atomique Libre meaning Free Atomic Scale The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time TCB Geocentric Coordinate Time TCG and Terrestrial Time TT All three of these time scales were defined to read JD January exactly at that instant The offset is to provide continuity with the older Ephemeris Time TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT with the equation TTTAI TAI s The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a letter from the BIPM to the ITU R which stated In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC 
Altruism Altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty Pure altruism consists of sacrificing something for someone other than the self e g sacrificing time energy or possessions with no expectation of any compensation or benefits either direct or indirect e g receiving recognition for the act of giving Much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others Used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which is defined as acting to the benefit of one s self The concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought The term was originally coined in the th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science Auguste Comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism In simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them A certain individual may behave altruistically in one case and egoistically in another situation However some individuals tend to behave more altruistically while others tend to behave more egoistically Altruism may be considered a general attitude to the point where altruism has been considered as a trait A study estimated that altruism was half inherited Another study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was published in Also based on the twin design the new study estimated that genetic differences accounted for approximately of individual variations Marcel Mauss s book The Gift contains a passage Note on alms This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice In it he writes Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other Generosity is an obligation because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it This is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children In the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor In evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies Some of the proposed mechanisms are Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts Instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment This need not imply that on average or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non competitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R Price s development of the Price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as Dictyostelium mucoroides These protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long term high cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his book and Peter Singer in his book A Darwinian Left Most recently Jeremy Griffith has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and LABS D Or Hospital Network J M provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging In their research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex However when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex septal region These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species Altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard wired and pleasurable Another experiment funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted in at the Duke University in Durham North Carolina suggests a different view that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it In the study published in the February print issue of Nature Neuroscience researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish people The researchers invited volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game In some rounds the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteer s choice During these activities the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI scans of the participants brains and were surprised by the results Although they were expecting to see activity in the brain s reward centers based on the idea that people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it what they found was that another part of the brain was also involved and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone else s gain That part of the brain is called the posterior superior temporal cortex pSTC In the next stage the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a person s tendency to act altruistically and compared each person s level of altruism against their fMRI brain scan The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a person s self reported level of altruism According to the researchers the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it We believe that the ability to perceive other people s actions as meaningful is critical for altruism said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing another s welfare Psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase one s own welfare There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism Some definitions specify a self sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors However because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question The social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits outweigh costs Daniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory He identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy induced altruism can be genuinely selfless The empathy altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another s suffering Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues In psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person s distress Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the Bystander effect Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility However a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders A feeling of personal responsibility or moral norm has also strongly been associated with other pro social behaviors such as charitable giving Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well being In a study of older adults those who volunteered were significantly higher on life satisfaction and will to live and significantly lower in depression anxiety and somatization Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a year period and found that of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only of those who did volunteer experienced one A study on adults ages found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a lower likelihood of dying After controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a reduction in mortality Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well being A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness It is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction that happier people are also kinder The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness For example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant Additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand in hand with kindness and is also very important for our well being A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and well being Psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others doing good and subsequently feeling good as the helper s high Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity American Sociological Association The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro social altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field The American Sociology Association ASA acknowledges Public sociology saying The intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity ASA This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies How altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society Most if not all of the world s religions promote altruism as a very important moral value Buddhism Christianity Hinduism Islam Jainism Judaism and Sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being Dalai Lama Since all beings includes the individual love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering In practical terms however since most of us are spontaneously self centered Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others and thus can be characterized as altruistic Many would agree with the Dalai Lama that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others Still the notion of altruism is modified in such a world view since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness The more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well being becomes Dalai Lama In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what I cause if I cause suffering then as a natural consequence I will experience suffering if I cause happiness then as a natural consequence I will experience happiness In Buddhism karma Pali kamma is strictly distinguished from vipaka meaning fruit or result Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause Pali hetu in the chain of cause and effect where it comprises the elements of volitional activities Pali sankhara and action Pali bhava Any action is understood to create seeds in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results Pali vipaka when they meet the right conditions Most types of karmas with good or bad results will keep one in the wheel of samsara others will liberate one to nirvana Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action Motivation usually makes the difference between good and bad but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance so a well intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be bad in that it creates unpleasant results for the actor In Buddhism karma is not the only cause of all that happens As taught in the early texts the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories known as Niyama Dhammas The fundamental principles of Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings Jainism preaches the view of Ahimsa to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings i e uncompromising reverence for all life It also considers all living things to be equal The first Thirthankar Rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non violence and compassion for all living things Jainism prescribes a path of non violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks They are A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors One s unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans Anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride ego by humility deceit by straight forwardness and greed by contentment The principle of non violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha Param atma highest soul Because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in one s actions Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small This policy extends even to microscopic organisms Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders The great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders In other words the house holders are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of non violence truthfulness non stealing celibacy and non possessiveness with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly With consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the Gospel especially in the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain From biblical to medieval Christian traditions tensions between self affirmation and other regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of disinterested love as in the Pauline phrase love seeks not its own interests In his book Indoctrination and Self deception Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self affirmation and altruism by analysis of other regard within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many Love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each person s experience and practice from within As in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection St Thomas Aquinas interprets You should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others Considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes Aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part However he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being In coining the word Altruism as stated above Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God John states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one s fellowman is the same as hatred of God Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love An altruistic action is not always a loving action Oord defines altruism as acting for the other s good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one s own good when the other s demands undermine overall well being German philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak One way is a sincere expression of Christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of one s own life and existence Another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people s business At its worst Scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse In Islam the concept ithar altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself For Sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one s own concerns where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by Allah on the human body considered to be property of Allah alone The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good Islam considers those practicing ithar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility This is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that European concept in i thar attention is focused on everything in existence A constant concern for Allah i e God results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like Rabia al Adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to Allah i e God and dedication to people Thirteenth century Turkish Sufi poet Yunus Emre explained this philosophy as Yarat lan severiz Yaratandan oturu or We love the creature because of The Creator For many Muslims i thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays However i thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation The famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity This is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in existence Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another Ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness The fifth Nanak Guru Arjun Dev Sacrificed his life to uphold Carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the Guru Granth The Ninth Nanak Guru Tegh Bahadur Sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity In the late th century Guru Gobind Singh Ji the tenth guru in Sikhism was in war with the Moghul rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh Bhai Kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield What were you doing and why asked the Guru I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them replied Bhai Kanhaiya The Guru responded Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same Advaita Vedanta differs from the view that karma is a law of cause and effect but instead additionally hold that karma is mediated by the will of a personal supreme god This view of karma is in contradiction to Buddhism Jainism and other Indian religions that do view karma as a law of cause and effect Swami Sivananda an Advaita scholar reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras a Vedantic text In his commentary on Chapter of the Brahma Sutras Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short lived and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed Hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one s merit Furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya which gives fruit Since apurva is non sentient it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment There exists a wide range of philosophical views on man s obligations or motivations to act altruistically Proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically The opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self interest Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which is the view that every individual s well being including one s own is of equal moral importance A related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own self interest and that true altruism is impossible Rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one s self interest without specifying how this affects one s moral obligations 
Ayn Rand Ayn Rand born Alisa Zinov yevna Rosenbaum March was an American novelist philosopher playwright and screenwriter She is known for her two best selling novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism Born and educated in Russia Rand moved to the United States in She had a play produced on Broadway in After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America she achieved fame with her novel The Fountainhead In she published her best known work the novel Atlas Shrugged Afterward she turned to non fiction to promote her philosophy publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism In politics she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism instead supporting laissez faire capitalism which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights In art Rand promoted romantic realism She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals Literary critics received Rand s fiction with mixed reviews and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy though academic interest has increased in recent decades The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas both to the public and in academic settings She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives Rand was born Alisa Zinov yevna Rosenbaum on February to a Russian Jewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife Anna Borisovna nee Kaplan largely non observant Jews Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist and businessman eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located With a passion for the liberal arts Rand found school unchallenging and said she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium her closest friend was Vladimir Nabokov s younger sister Olga The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates while Nabokov defended constitutional monarchy Rand supported republican ideals She was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the comfortable life the family had previously enjoyed Her father s business was confiscated and the family displaced They fled to the Crimean Peninsula which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War She later recalled that while in high school she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue After graduating from high school in the Crimea at Rand returned with her family to Petrograd as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time where they faced desperate conditions on occasion nearly starving After the Russian Revolution universities were opened to women allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University where at the age of only she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato who would be her greatest influence and counter influence respectively A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was Friedrich Nietzsche Able to read French German and Russian Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky Victor Hugo Edmond Rostand and Friedrich Schiller who became her perennial favorites Along with many other bourgeois students Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating However after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate which Rand did in October She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad For one of her assignments she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri which became her first published work By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand possibly as a Cyrillic contraction of her birth surname and she adopted the first name Ayn either from a Finnish name or from the Hebrew word ayin meaning eye In the fall of Rand was granted a visa to visit American relatives She departed on January When she arrived in New York City on February she was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan that she cried what she later called tears of splendor Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with relatives in Chicago one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free She then set out for Hollywood California Initially Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses A chance meeting with famed director Cecil B DeMille led to a job as an extra in his film The King of Kings as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter While working on The King of Kings she met an aspiring young actor Frank O Connor the two were married on April Rand became an American citizen in Taking various jobs during the s to support her writing she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate Rand s first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in although it was never produced This was followed by the courtroom drama Night of January th first produced by E E Clive in Hollywood in and then successfully reopened on Broadway in Each night the jury was selected from members of the audience and one of the two different endings depending on the jury s verdict would then be performed In Paramount Pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result Rand s first novel the semi autobiographical We the Living was published in Set in Soviet Russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state In a foreword to the novel Rand stated that We the Living is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write It is not an autobiography in the literal but only in the intellectual sense The plot is invented the background is not Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print although European editions continued to sell After the success of her later novels Rand was able to release a revised version in that has since sold over three million copies Without Rand s knowledge or permission the novel was made into a pair of Italian films Noi vivi and Addio Kira in Rediscovered in the s these films were re edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re released as We the Living in Her novella Anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel The Fountainhead It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word I has been forgotten and replaced with we It was published in England in but Rand initially could not find an American publisher As with We the Living Rand s later success allowed her to get a revised version published in which has sold more than million copies During the s Rand became politically active Both she and her husband worked full time in volunteer positions for the presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie This work led to Rand s first public speaking experiences including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro Willkie newsreels an experience she greatly enjoyed This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free market capitalism She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises Despite her philosophical differences with them Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and both of them expressed admiration for her Once Mises referred to Rand as the most courageous man in America a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of woman Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson Rand questioned the well informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book The God of the Machine Rand s first major success as a writer came with The Fountainhead in a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as second handers those who attempt to live through others placing others above themselves It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it While completing the novel Rand was prescribed Benzedrine a brand of amphetamine to fight fatigue The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel but when the book was done she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest Her continued use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings The Fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success bringing Rand fame and financial security In Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay Finishing her work on that screenplay she was hired by producer Hal Wallis as a screenwriter and script doctor Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscar nominated Love Letters and You Came Along This role gave Rand time to work on other projects including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism Although the planned book was never completed a condensed version was published as an essay titled The Only Path to Tomorrow in the January edition of Reader s Digest magazine Rand extended her involvement with free market and anti communist activism while working in Hollywood She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals a Hollywood anti Communist group and wrote articles on the group s behalf She also joined the anti Communist American Writers Association A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand s California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies In during the Second Red Scare Rand testified as a friendly witness before the United States House Un American Activities Committee Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the film Song of Russia Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was She wanted to also criticize the lauded film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but she was not allowed to testify about it When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations Rand described the process as futile After several delays the film version of The Fountainhead was released in Although it used Rand s screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end complaining about its editing acting and other elements In the years following the publication of The Fountainhead Rand received numerous letters from readers some of whom it profoundly influenced In Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City where she gathered a group of these admirers around her This group jokingly designated The Collective included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal later Nathaniel Branden and his wife Barbara and Barbara s cousin Leonard Peikoff At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel Atlas Shrugged as the manuscript pages were written In Rand s close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair with the consent of their spouses Atlas Shrugged published in was considered Rand s magnum opus Rand described the theme of the novel as the role of the mind in man s existence and as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational self interest It advocates the core tenets of Rand s philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy The novel s hero and leader of the strike John Galt describes the strike as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation s wealth and achievement With this fictional strike Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive the economy would collapse and society would fall apart The novel includes elements of romance mystery and science fiction and it contains Rand s most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt Despite many negative reviews Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller and in an interview with Mike Wallace Rand declared herself the most creative thinker alive After completing the novel Rand fell into a severe depression Atlas Shrugged was Rand s last completed work of fiction a turning point in her life it marked the end of Rand s career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher In Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute NBI to promote Rand s philosophy Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited Rand later published some of these articles in book form Critics including some former NBI students and Branden himself have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her However some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated with the problem being concentrated among Rand s closest followers in New York Throughout the s and s Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale Princeton Columbia Harvard and MIT She received an honorary doctorate from Lewis Clark College in She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum responding afterward to questions from the audience During these speeches and Q A sessions she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day These included supporting abortion rights opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as bums supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of against a coalition of Arab nations as civilized men fighting savages saying European colonists had the right to take land from American Indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it She also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States most strongly Barry Goldwater in whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter In Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott whom he later married Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand When she learned of it in though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens which led to the closure of NBI Rand published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life Branden later apologized in an interview to every student of Objectivism for perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique and for contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement In subsequent years Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in after decades of heavy smoking In she retired from writing her newsletter and despite her initial objections allowed Evva Pryor a social worker from her attorney s office to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare During the late s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on November One of her final projects was work on a never completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged Rand died of heart failure on March at her home in New York City and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery Valhalla New York Rand s funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including Alan Greenspan A floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket In her will Rand named Leonard Peikoff the heir to her estate Rand called her philosophy Objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and aesthetics In metaphysics Rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion In epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man s senses She rejected all claims of non perceptual or a priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic synthetic dichotomy In ethics Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational self interest as the guiding moral principle She said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself She referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing a meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of man s survival qua man She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in Atlas Shrugged that Force and mind are opposites Rand s political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights She opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy Nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship Rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism She worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics She denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism She rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice Rand s aesthetics defined art as a selective re creation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgments According to Rand art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness As a writer the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will She described her own approach to literature as romantic realism Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three A s Aristotle Aquinas and Ayn Rand In a interview with Mike Wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded Out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me I devised the rest of my philosophy myself However she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand s journals in passages from the first edition of We the Living which Rand later revised and in her overall writing style However by the time she wrote The Fountainhead Rand had turned against Nietzsche s ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant whom she referred to as a monster although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts her ethics and her discovery in politics that evil the violation of rights consists of the initiation of force She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows During Rand s lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation Rand s first novel We the Living was admired by the literary critic H L Mencken her Broadway play Night of January th was both a critical and popular success and The Fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in The New York Times as masterful Rand s novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic However they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth The first reviews Rand received were for Night of January th Reviews of the production were largely positive but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer Rand believed that her first novel We the Living was not widely reviewed but Rand scholar Michael S Berliner says it was the most reviewed of any of her works with approximately different reviews being published in more than publications Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work Her novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re issues Rand s first bestseller The Fountainhead received far fewer reviews than We the Living and reviewers opinions were mixed There was a positive review in The New York Times that Rand greatly appreciated The reviewer called Rand a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time There were other positive reviews but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it a whale of a book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper rationing Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand s style offensively pedestrian Rand s novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative In the National Review conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly He described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused Rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the Soviets claiming From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding To a gas chamber go Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put downs calling it execrable claptrap and a nightmare they said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity Author Flannery O Connor wrote in a letter to a friend that The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail Rand s nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book For the New Intellectual was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers On the th anniversary of Rand s birth in Edward Rothstein writing for The New York Times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neo Romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society In book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as romance novels with a patina of pseudo philosophy In GQ s critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as capitalism s version of middlebrow religious novels such as and the Left Behind series In a survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent s life was Rand s Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice after the Bible Rand s books continue to be widely sold and read with over million copies sold as of with about of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute Although Rand s influence has been greatest in the United States there has been international interest in her work Rand s work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India Rand s contemporary admirers included fellow novelists such as Ira Levin Kay Nolte Smith and L Neil Smith and later writers such as Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind have been influenced by her Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko and musician Neil Peart of Rush Rand provided a positive view of business and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work John Allison of BB T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand s ideas while Mark Cuban owner of the Dallas Mavericks and John P Mackey CEO of Whole Foods among others have said they consider Rand crucial to their success Rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media on television shows including animated sitcoms live action comedies dramas and game shows as well as in movies and video games She or characters based on her figure prominently in positive and negative lights in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors Nick Gillespie editor in chief of Reason has remarked that Rand s is a tortured immortality one in which she s as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist and that jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture Two movies have been made about Rand s life A documentary film was nominated for the Academy Award for Documentary Feature The Passion of Ayn Rand a television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards Rand s image also appears on a U S postage stamp designed by artist Nick Gaetano Although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian Rand has had continuing influence on right wing politics and libertarianism Jim Powell a senior fellow at the Cato Institute considers Rand one of the three most important women along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson of modern American libertarianism and David Nolan one of the founders of the Libertarian Party stated that without Ayn Rand the libertarian movement would not exist In his history of the libertarian movement journalist Brian Doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right She faced intense opposition from William F Buckley Jr and other contributors for the National Review magazine They published numerous criticisms in the s and s by Whittaker Chambers Garry Wills and M Stanton Evans Nevertheless her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other National Review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the United States Republican Party despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives such as being pro choice and an atheist A article in The New York Times referred to her as the Reagan administration s novelist laureate Republican Congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels The late s financial crisis spurred renewed interest in her works especially Atlas Shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis and opinion articles compared real world events with the plot of the novel During this time signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests There was also increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan For example Mother Jones remarked that Rand s particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy the talented and the powerful as the oppressed while The Nation alleged similarities between the moral syntax of Randianism and fascism During Rand s lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars When the first academic book about Rand s philosophy appeared in its author declared writing about Rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously A few articles about Rand s ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in many of them in The Personalist One of these was On the Randian Argument by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick who argued that her meta ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is ought problem posed by David Hume Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in The Personalist arguing that Nozick misstated Rand s case Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand s novels when she began researching her in and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the s Since Rand s death interest in her work has gradually increased Historian Jennifer Burns has identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in Rand the most recent of which is an explosion of scholarship since the year However few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study Gladstein Chris Matthew Sciabarra Allan Gotthelf Edwin A Locke and Tara Smith have taught her work in academic institutions Sciabarra co edits the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies a nonpartisan peer reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand s philosophical and literary work In Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society with George Walsh and David Kelley and has been active in sponsoring seminars about Rand and her ideas Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand s ideas including Ayn Rand s Normative Ethics The Virtuous Egoist a volume on Rand s ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press Rand s ideas have also been made subjects of study at Clemson and Duke universities Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the s Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B Rasmussen while stressing the importance and originality of her thought describe her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage Rand s ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought In the Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in John David Lewis declared that Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation In a interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education Sciabarra commented I know they laugh at Rand while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community Libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer has argued that very few people find Rand s ideas convincing especially her ethics which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence He attributes the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist Thus Atlas Shrugged outsells not only the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as Ludwig von Mises Friedrich Hayek or Frederic Bastiat but also Rand s own non fiction works Political scientist Charles Murray while praising Rand s literary accomplishments criticizes her claim that her only philosophical debt was to Aristotle instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche According to Murray By insisting that Objectivism had sprung full blown from her own mind with just a little help from Aristotle Rand was being childish as well as out of touch with reality Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system philosopher Robert H Bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas In Rand s heir Leonard Peikoff established the Ayn Rand Institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand s ideas and works In philosopher David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies now known as The Atlas Society In historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia The charitable foundation of BB T Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rand s ideas or works The University of Texas at Austin the University of Pittsburgh and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are among the schools that have received grants In some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand

Algeria Algeria or Literary Arabic Tamazight Dzayer officially People s Democratic Republic of Algeria is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa on the Mediterranean coast Its capital and most populous city is Algiers With a total area of Algeria is the tenth largest country in the world and the largest in Africa and in the Mediterranean The country is bordered in the northeast by Tunisia in the east by Libya in the west by Morocco in the southwest by Western Sahara Mauritania and Mali in the southeast by Niger and in the north by the Mediterranean Sea The territory of today s Algeria was the home of many ancient prehistoric cultures including Aterian and Capsian cultures Its area has known many empires and dynasties including ancient Berber Numidians Phoenecians Lybio Punic Carthaginians Romans Vandals Byzantines Arab Umayyads Arab Abbasids Arab Fatimids Berber Almoravids Berber Almohads Turkish Ottomans and the French colonial empire Algeria is a semi presidential republic it consists of provinces and communes With a population of million it is the th most populated country on Earth Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been the President of Algeria since and has won four consecutive elections However according to the Democracy Index Algeria is an authoritarian regime Algeria s economy is largely based on hydrocarbons due to which manufacturing has suffered from Dutch disease The country supplies large amounts of natural gas to Europe and energy exports are the backbone of the economy According to OPEC Algeria has th largest reserves of oil in the world and second largest in Africa while it has the th largest reserves of natural gas Sonatrach the national oil company is the largest company in Africa Algeria has the second largest military in North Africa with the largest defense budget in Africa Algeria has had a peaceful nuclear program since the s Algeria is a member of the African Union the Arab League OPEC and the United Nations and is a founding member of the Arab Maghreb Union The country s name derives from the city of Algiers The city s name in turn derives from the Arabic al Jaza ir The Islands a truncated form of the older Jaza ir Bani Mazghanna Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe employed by medieval geographers such as al Idrisi At Ain Hanech region Saida Province early remnants BC of hominid occupation in North Africa were found Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian and Mousterian styles BC similar to those in the Levant Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques Tools of this era starting about BC are called Aterian after the archeological site of Bir el Ater south of Tebessa The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called Iberomaurusian located mainly in Oran region This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the Maghreb between and BC Neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghrib between and BC This life richly depicted in the Tassili n Ajjer paintings predominated in Algeria until the classical period The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called Berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa From their principal center of power at Carthage the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast by BC a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa east of Cherchell Hippo Regius modern Annaba and Rusicade modern Skikda These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages As Carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organization supported several states Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others By the early th century BC Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army In the Revolt of the Mercenaries Berber soldiers rebelled from to BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage s North African territory and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the Punic Wars In BC the city of Carthage was destroyed As Carthaginian power waned the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew By the nd century BC several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged Two of them were established in Numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage West of Numidia lay Mauretania which extended across the Moulouya River in modern day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean The high point of Berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of Massinissa in the nd century BC After Masinissa s death in BC the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times Massinissa s line survived until AD when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman Empire For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans who founded many colonies in the region Like the rest of North Africa Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products The Vandals of Geiseric moved into North Africa in and by controlled coastal Numidia They did not make any significant settlement on the land The region was later recaptured by the Eastern Roman Empire which ruled it until the Muslim Conquest in the th century Muslim Arabs conquered Algeria in the mid th century and a large number of locals converted to the new faith After the fall of the Umayyad Arab Dynasty in numerous local Berber dynasties emerged including the Aghlabids Almohads Abdalwadid Zirids Rustamids Hammadids Almoravids and the Fatimids Having converted the Berber Kutama of the Petite Kabylie to its cause the Shia Fatimids overthrew the Rustamids and conquered Egypt leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their Zirid vassals When the latter rebelled the Fatimids sent in the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arabian tribes who unexpectedly defeated the Zirids During the Middle Ages the Fatimids or the sons of Fatima bent Muhammad as they were descended from Fatima the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad according to Fatimid claims came to the Maghreb These Fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb Hejaz and the Levant boasting a secular inner government and a powerful military and navy primarily made up of the native North Africans or the Imazighen The Indigenous Imazighen depending on location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb at times even unifying it as under the Fatimids as well as overseas conquests of Portugal Senegal Spain Sicily Egypt Sudan Syria Saudi Arabia Israel Palestine Jordan Iraq and Yemen Caliphates from Northern Africa traded tit for tat with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the highly competitive Islamic Era The Berbers or Imazighen consisted of several tribes The two main branches were the Botr and Barnes tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub tribes Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes for example Sanhadja Houaras Zenata Masmouda Kutama Awarba and Berghwata All these tribes were independent and made territorial decisions Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands Ibn Khaldun provides a table summarizing the Berber dynasties of the Maghreb region the Zirid Banu Ifran Maghrawa Almoravid Hammadid Almohad Merinid Abdalwadid Wattasid Meknassa and Hafsid dynasties In the early th century Spain constructed fortified outposts presidios on or near the Algerian coast Spain took control of Mers el Kebir in Oran in and Tlemcen Mostaganem and Tenes in In the same year the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain which built a fort on it The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain s merchant fleet In the Muslim privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa who operated successfully under the Hafsids moved their base of operations to Algiers When Aruj was killed in during his invasion of Tlemcen Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers The Ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some janissaries With the aid of this force Hayreddin subdued the coastal region between Constantine and Oran although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until The next beylerbey was Hayreddin s son Hasan who assumed the position in Until the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits Subsequently with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for three year terms The pasha was assisted by janissaries known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha As a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in Plague had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa Algiers lost from to inhabitants to the plague in and suffered high fatalities in and In the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power The new leader received the title of dey After the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty notables It was at first dominated by the ojaq but by the th century it had become the dey s instrument In the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat The dey was elected for a life term but in the years that the system survived fourteen of the twenty nine deys were assassinated Despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the day to day operation of government was remarkably orderly Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest Autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regency s authority was seldom applied in the Kabylie The Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other non Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives According to Robert Davis from the th to th century pirates captured million to million Europeans as slaves They often made raids called Razzias on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire In Hayreddin captured the island of Ischia taking prisoners and enslaved some inhabitants of Lipari almost the entire population In Turgut Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo between and sending the captives to Libya In pirates sacked Vieste in southern Italy and took an estimated captives as slaves In Barbary corsairs captured the town of Ciutadella Minorca destroyed it slaughtered the inhabitants and took survivors as slaves to Istanbul Barbary pirates often attacked the Balearic Islands and in response the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of Formentera Between to England lost merchant ships to Barbary pirates In the th century the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers paying a license tax in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from to Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the First and Second Barbary Wars Following those wars Algeria was weaker and Europeans with an Anglo Dutch fleet commanded by the British Lord Exmouth attacked Algiers After a nine hour bombardment they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by Decatur US navy concerning the demands of tributes In addition the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians On the pretext of a slight to their consul the French invaded and captured Algiers in The conquest of Algeria by the French took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly one third from to The population of Algeria which stood at about million in reached nearly million in French policy was predicated on civilizing the country Algeria s social fabric suffered during the occupation literacy plummeted During this period a small but influential French speaking indigenous elite was formed made up of Berbers mostly from Kabyles In the French policy of divide to reign its government favored the Kabyles About of Indigenous Schools were constructed for Kabyles From until independence France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and departement of the nation One of France s longest held overseas territories Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants who became known as colons and later as Pied Noirs Between and French people emigrated to Algeria These settlers benefited from the French government s confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land Gradually dissatisfaction among the Muslim population which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began Historians have estimated that between and Harkis and their dependents were killed by the Front de Liberation Nationale FLN or by lynch mobs in Algeria The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war and the French conducted severe reprisals and repression The war concluded in when Algeria gained complete independence following the March Evian agreements and the July self determination referendum Algeria s first president was the FLN leader Ahmed Ben Bella Morocco s claim to portions of western Algeria led to the Sand War in Ben Bella was overthrown in by Houari Boumediene his former ally and defense minister Under Ben Bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian Boumedienne continued this trend But he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role He collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive Oil extraction facilities were nationalized This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international oil crisis In the s and s under President Houari Boumediene Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a state controlled socialist economy Boumediene s successor Chadli Bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms He promoted a policy of Arabisation in Algerian society and public life Teachers of Arabic brought in from other Muslim countries spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the s oil glut Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the s by the end of the decade Bendjedid introduced a multi party system Political parties developed such as the Islamic Salvation Front FIS a broad coalition of Islamist groups In December the Islamic Salvation Front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections Fearing the election of an Islamist government the authorities intervened on January cancelling the elections Bendjedid resigned and a High Council of State was installed to act as Presidency It banned the FIS triggering a civil insurgency between the Front s armed wing the Armed Islamic Group and the national armed forces in which more than persons are thought to have died The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres At several points in the conflict the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern most notably during the crisis surrounding Air France Flight a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October Algeria held elections in considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a Civil Concord initiative approved in a referendum under which many political prisoners were pardoned and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty in force until January The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly The Groupe Salafiste pour la Predication et le Combat GSPC a splinter group of the Group Islamic Armee continued a terrorist campaign against the Government Bouteflika was re elected in the April presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation The programme comprised economic institutional political and social reform to modernise the country raise living standards and tackle the causes of alienation It also included a second amnesty initiative the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation which was approved in a referendum in September It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces In November the Algerian Constitution was amended following a vote in Parliament removing the two term limit on Presidential incumbents This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re election in the presidential elections and he was re elected in April During his election campaign and following his re election Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a billion spending programme to create three million new jobs the construction of one million new housing units and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on December inspired by similar protests across the Middle East and North Africa On February the government lifted Algeria s year old state of emergency The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties the electoral code and the representation of women in elected bodies In April Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform However elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue Algeria is the largest country in Africa the Arab world and the Mediterranean Basin Its southern part includes a significant portion of the Sahara To the north the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas further south two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria The vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border The highest point is Mount Tahat m Algeria lies mostly between latitudes and N a small area is north of and longitudes W and E Most of the coastal area is hilly sometimes even mountainous and there are a few natural harbours The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile South of the Tell Atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the Saharan Atlas farther south there is the Sahara desert The Ahaggar Mountains also known as the Hoggar are a highland region in central Sahara southern Algeria They are located about south of the capital Algiers and just west of Tamanghasset Algiers Oran Constantine and Annaba are Algeria s main cities In this region midday desert temperatures can be hot year round After sunset however the clear dry air permits rapid loss of heat and the nights are cool to chilly Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded The highest official temperature was at In Salah Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas ranging from annually the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east Precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria where it reaches as much as in some years Farther inland the rainfall is less plentiful Algeria also has ergs or sand dunes between mountains Among these in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty temperatures can get up to The varied vegetation of Algeria includes coastal mountainous and grassy desert like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization The most commonly seen animals include the wild boars jackals and gazelles although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs foxes and jerboas Algeria also has a few leopard and cheetah populations but these are seldom seen A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals Barbary macaques are the sole native monkey Snakes monitor lizards and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of Algeria Many animals are now extinct among which the Barbary lions and bears In the north some of the native flora includes Macchia scrub olive trees oaks cedars and other conifers The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens Aleppo pine juniper and evergreen oak and some deciduous trees Fig eucalyptus agave and various palm trees grow in the warmer areas The grape vine is indigenous to the coast In the Sahara region some oases have palm trees Acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the Sahara Camels are used extensively the desert also abounds with poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes scorpions and numerous insects Algeria is an authoritarian regime according to the Democracy Index The Freedom of the Press report gives it rating Not Free Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria Instead a group of unelected civilian and military decideurs known as le pouvoir the power actually rule the country even deciding who should be president The most powerful man may be Mohamed Mediene head of the military intelligence In recent years many of these generals have died or retired After the death of General Larbi Belkheir Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts notably at Sonatrach and secured constitutional amendments that make him re electable indefinitely The head of state is the president of Algeria who is elected for a five year term The president was formerly limited to two five year terms but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on November removed this limitation Algeria has universal suffrage at years of age The President is the head of the army the Council of Ministers and the High Security Council He appoints the Prime Minister who is also the head of government The Algerian parliament is bicameral the lower house the People s National Assembly has members who are directly elected for five year terms while the upper house the Council of the Nation has members serving six year terms of which members are chosen by local assemblies and are appointed by the president According to the constitution no political association may be formed if it is based on differences in religion language race gender profession or region In addition political campaigns must be exempt from the aforementioned subjects Parliamentary elections were last held in May and were judged to be largely free by international monitors though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities In the elections the FLN won seats the military backed National Rally for Democracy won and the Islamist Green Algeria Alliance won In October Algeria cancelled a weapons deal with France over the possibility of inclusion of Israeli parts in them Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the Arab Maghreb Union nominally established in but which has carried little practical weight Algeria is included in the European Union s European Neighbourhood Policy ENP which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer Giving incentives and rewarding best performers as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument ENI that came into force in It has a budget of EUR billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes The military of Algeria consists of the People s National Army ANP the Algerian National Navy MRA and the Algerian Air Force QJJ plus the Territorial Air Defense Force It is the direct successor of the Armee de Liberation Nationale ALN the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial occupation during the Algerian War of Independence Total military personnel include active reserve and paramilitary staff estimate Service in the military is compulsory for men aged for a total of months six training and in civil projects The military expenditure was of the gross domestic product GDP in Algeria has the second largest military in North Africa with the largest defense budget in Africa billion In the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase MiG SMT and MiG UBT at an estimated cost of billion It also agreed to return old aircraft purchased from the former USSR Russia is also building two type diesel submarines for Algeria Algeria is divided into provinces wilayas districts dairas and municipalities baladiyahs Each province district and municipality is named after its seat which is usually the largest city The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence When introducing new provinces the numbers of old provinces are kept hence the non alphabetical order With their official numbers currently since they are Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the World Bank Algeria s currency is the dinar DZD The economy remains dominated by the state a legacy of the country s socialist post independence development model In recent years the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy The government s efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages The country is facing a number of short term and medium term problems including the need to diversify the economy strengthen political economic and financial reforms improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions A wave of economic protests in February and March prompted the Algerian government to offer more than billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases Public spending has increased by annually during the past years The public investment programme will cost US billion of which will go to human development The Algerian economy grew by in driven by public spending in particular in the construction and public works sector and by growing internal demand If hydrocarbons are excluded growth has been estimated at Growth of is expected in rising to in The rate of inflation was and the budget deficit of GDP The current account surplus is estimated at of GDP and at the end of December official reserves were put at US billion Inflation the lowest in the region has remained stable at on average between and In Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of billion increase in comparison to surplus In general the country exported billion worth of commodities while it imported billion Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues Algeria has a cushion of billion in

persona of a worthless playboy by which he is known to the world as an effective cover However he is forced to give up Dagny knowing that she would not be ready to join the strikers He remains deeply in love with her throughout the book while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers Hank Rearden and John Galt His full name is given as Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d Anconia The enigmatic John Galt is the primary male hero of Atlas Shrugged He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental who often dines with Eddie Willers in the

heralded speech at the end of the book and give his long soliloquy Henry also known as Hank is one of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged Like many of Rand s capitalist characters he is a self made man He owns the most important steel company in the United States He invents Rearden Metal an alloy stronger than steel with similar properties to stainless steel He lives in Philadelphia with his wife Lillian his brother Philip and his elderly mother all of whom he supports Hank Rearden knows something is wrong with the world but he is unable to define the problem His friend Francisco d Anconia helps him understand and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in Galt s Speech Rearden also serves to illustrate Rand s theory of sex Lillian Rearden cannot appreciate Hank Rearden s virtues and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex Dagny Taggart clearly does appreciate Rearden s virtues and this appreciation evolves into sexual desire Rearden is torn because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct but he responds sexually to Dagny who represents his highest values Rearden

courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt he does everything he can to keep the railroad running as the country falls apart When the train he is riding on breaks down he tries in vain to repair it as the passengers and crew abandon him then collapses sobbing on the tracks One of the original

Danneskjold seizes relief ships that are being sent from the United States to The People s States of Europe As the novel progresses Danneskjold begins to become active in American waters Danneskjold s action is to restore to other creative people the money in gold which was unjustly taken away from them specifically their income tax payments He explains this is not altruism his motivation is to ensure that once those espousing Galt s philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society they will have enough capital to rebuild the world Kept in the background for much of the book Danneskjold makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet Hank Rearden in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an advance payment to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation Danneskjold is married to the actress Kay Ludlow their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world which only knows of Ludlow as a film star who retired and dropped out of

peddler who is however incapable of making operational decisions on his own He relies on his sister Dagny Taggart to actually run the railroad but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor In a sense he is the antithesis of Dagny As the novel progresses the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed it is a code of stagnation The goal of this code is to not exist to not move forward to become a zero Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal He maintains his pretense that he wants to live and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself

suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden They have been married eight years as the novel begins Lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband She compares being Rearden s wife with owning the world s most powerful horse Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast she must bridle it down to her level even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is realistic enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts She indicates that she abhors Francisco d Anconia because she believes he is a sexual adventurer As her motives become more clear Lillian is found to share the sentiments of many other moochers and their worship of destruction Her actions are explained as the desire to destroy achievement in the false belief that such an act bestows a greatness to the destroyer equal to the accomplishment destroyed She seeks then to ruin Rearden in an effort to prove her own value Lillian achieves her goal to destroy Rearden s business when she passes on information to James Taggart about her husband s affair This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign the Gift Certificate which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to the looters and thereby destroys his business Lillian discovers that she can accomplish her goal to destroy the business but she can neither achieve the greatness
